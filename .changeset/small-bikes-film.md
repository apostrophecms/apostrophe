Fix hardcoded help text in Layout Column fields. Rename the existing `breakpoints` option to `labelBreakpoints` for clarity. The old option is deprecated but still supported for BC reasons. Add new `showBreakpointsHelp` option (default `true`). If set to `false`, the "Show tablet/mobile" fields help text will be removed from the UI.
