In `@apostrophecms/i18n` add `direction` property to locale configuration to support RTL languages (e.g., `he`, `ar`), `slugDirection` option to control default direction of slug fields. Add `direction` property in the schema field definitions to override and validate text direction (supports `ltr` and `rtl`) of input fields.
