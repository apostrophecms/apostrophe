# Reporting a Bug
If you come across a bug, please submit an issue in the GitHub repo. Since, that’s the primary source for bug documentation, first search the existing issues and make sure it hasn’t been logged yet. If it hasn’t please include the following details as they apply:

1. Steps to reproduce.
2. Expected behavior and actual behavior.
3. Screenshots or animated .GIFs to help illustrate the behavior.
4. Code samples.

Finally remember to attach the “Bug” label to the issue, to help use stay organized.

Bonus: Although not required, if you write a test that reproduces the bug you found, and submit that failing test as a PR… well, we might even send you some swag 😉.

# Fixing Bugs or Submitting Enhancements
If you’ve perused our open issues labelled “Bug” and decide to work to resolve one, or you’ve got a new feature that you’d like to commit to the core project, please keep these things in mind:

1. Make sure your PR includes tests. If it’s a bug fix that test should reproduce the issue and then should illustrate its resolvution when your code is implemented (if you can’t write a test for the bug you are addresses, please note the reason why).
2. Run ESLint to be sure your update adheres to our coding standards.
3. Enhancements should include documentation and include implementation details were applicable.

# Suggesting a feature or enhancement 
We also track feature requests and larger scale enhancements within the Github repository. After a search of existing issues to confirm your idea is unique, please feel free to submit your ideas as a new issue. Remember to include a details that articulate the current functionality and how this enhancement will improve and build upon that.

Attaching images to illustrate your feature 

Adding the label of “enhancement” along with categorizing your issue with an existing label such as UI, UX, Accessibility, Security, etc. will help the team stay organized and be greatly appreciated.
