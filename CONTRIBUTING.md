# Contributions Made Easy

Of course, we welcome traditional open source contributions via pull requests and new open issues to our GitHub repository. If you‚Äôd like to dig in right away see issues with the [‚Äúcontributions welcome‚Äù label](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22).

Detailed information about submitting code contributions and new issues to our GitHub repository are documented below.

# Reporting a Bug
If you come across a bug, please submit an issue in the GitHub repo. That‚Äôs the primary source for bug documentation, so first be sure to search the existing issues and make sure it hasn‚Äôt been logged. If it hasn‚Äôt, please include the following details as they apply:

1. Steps to reproduce the bug.
2. The expected behavior and actual behavior.
3. Screenshots or animated .GIFs to help illustrate the behavior.
4. Code samples.

Finally, remember to attach the ‚ÄúBug‚Äù label to the issue, to help use stay organized.

Bonus: Although not required, if you write a test that reproduces the bug you found, and submit that failing test as a PR‚Ä¶ well, we might even send you some swag üòâ.

# Suggesting a Feature or Enhancement 
We also track feature requests and larger scale enhancements within the GitHub repository. After a search of existing issues to confirm your idea is unique, please feel free to submit your idea as a new issue. Remember to include details that articulate the current functionality and how this enhancement will improve or build upon that. Attaching images to illustrate your feature is often useful.

Adding the label of ‚Äúenhancement‚Äù along with categorizing your issue with an existing label such as UI, UX, Accessibility, Security, etc. will help the team stay organized and is greatly appreciated.

# Fixing Bugs or Submitting Enhancements
If you‚Äôve perused our open issues labeled ‚ÄúBug‚Äù and decide to work to resolve one, or you‚Äôve got a new feature that you‚Äôd like to commit to the core project, please keep these things in mind:

1. Make sure your pull request includes tests. [For examples of back-end unit tests, look here](
https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/tree/master/test) at the test folder of the apostrophe module. This level of coverage is expected for backend features that aren't already covered by a test. [For examples of front-end, browser-based regression tests, checkout the apostrophe-enterprise-testbed module](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-enterprise-testbed). We don't expect that every contributor is ready to write Nightwatch tests like these, but it is surely appreciated. If it‚Äôs a bug fix you should have a test that reproduces the issue (if you can‚Äôt write a test for the bug you are addressing, please note the reason why).
2. Run ESLint to be sure your update adheres to our coding standards. The `apostrophe` module already has a `.eslintrc` file, so the simplest way is to run: `npx eslint .` Your editor may automatically point out eslint-detected concerns as well.
3. Enhancements should include documentation and include implementation details were applicable.

# Should you make a new npm module?

Great question. If it's not a bug fix or an improvement to the core UI, it often doesn't belong in the core `apostrophe` npm module. For instance, our blogging functionality is in the separate `apostrophe-blog` npm module.
