# Jot Wiki

Jot Wiki is a simple demo app for [Jot](http://github.com/boutell/jot). 

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Launch

    node wiki.js

## Usage

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to feast your eyes on Jot Wiki.

The test username is `admin` and the test password is `demo`.

In addition to the home page, you can make other pages just by visiting them (edit the address bar and press enter).

A wiki is a good test program for Jot because it requires the infrastructure of any other CMS but doesn't need an elaborate system for managing page trees, which is an interesting but entirely separate problem.
