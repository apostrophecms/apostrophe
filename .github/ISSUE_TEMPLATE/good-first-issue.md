What is the issue to be solved?

How should it be solved? Be specific. Where possible link to specific files to be edited or at least give their paths to help the developer get started.

Is there anything specific the user should already be familiar with? You may assume basic JavaScript, but should not assume Nunjucks templates, moog, etc. Links to the Apostrophe documentation are very helpful here.
