Please ensure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- [ ] Link to the related issue with requirements and/or clearly describe 1) what problem this solves and 2) the requirements to review it against.
- [ ] Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the added feature or fix. If there is not yet a heading for an upcoming release, add one following the established pattern.
- [ ] Keep the pull request minimal! Break large updates into separate pull requests for individual features/fixes whenever possible. Small requests get reviewed more quickly.
- [ ] All tests must pass, including the linters. Run `npm run lint` to test code linting independently.

Thanks for contributing!
