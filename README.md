## About

ApostropheCMS is a full-stack content management system built with Node.js and MongoDB. Content creators can edit directly on live pages without switching between admin interfaces, while developers can build with modern JavaScript or use it headlessly with any frontend framework.

### Key Features

- **üéØ In-Context Editing** - Content creators edit directly on the live page, seeing changes instantly
- **‚ö° Headless-Ready** - Use any frontend framework while keeping the powerful admin experience
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer-First** - Built with Node.js and MongoDB for full-stack JavaScript development
- **üìà Scales Beautifully** - From small sites to enterprise applications handling millions of pages
- **üîê Enterprise Features** - Advanced permissions, workflow management, automated translations, and more

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Installation Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Node.js** | 20.x+ | Use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for version management |
| **MongoDB** | 6.0+ | [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) (cloud) or local install |
| **npm** | 10.x+ | Included with Node.js |

See our [setup guides](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/guide/development-setup.html) for installation instructions.

## Quick Start

Get ApostropheCMS running locally in minutes:

```bash
# Option 1: Install CLI globally (recommended for multiple projects)
npm install -g @apostrophecms/cli
apos create my-website
cd my-website
npm run dev

# Option 2: Use npx for one-time project creation
npx @apostrophecms/cli create my-website
cd my-website
npm run dev
```

Your new ApostropheCMS site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with a powerful admin interface at `/login`.

### Prefer to Go Headless?

**Get started with Astro integration** - the easiest way to build headless sites while keeping visual editing:

- **[Apollo Starter Kit (Astro)](https://apostrophecms.com/starter-kits/apollo-starter-kit-for-astro-cms)** - Production-ready foundation with beautiful design system and rich content features
- **[Essentials Starter Kit (Astro)](git clone https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro-essentials)** - Minimal, clean foundation for building custom designs from scratch

Both starter kits provide headless CMS power with in-context editing, letting content creators edit directly on the live site while you build with modern frontend tools. Our Astro integration handles all the content fetching automatically‚Äîno REST API calls to write.

**Desire a different frontend framework?** Use our REST APIs with React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework:

- **[REST API Documentation](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/reference/api/pieces.html)** - Complete API reference
- **[Headless CMS Guide](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/guide/headless-cms.html)** - Integration walkthrough for any framework
