## Getting Started

The [ApostropheCMS documentation](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/index.html) will walk you through some simple steps to get your [local environment set up](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html) with the technology stack that runs ApostropheCMS (Node.js, MongoDB, ImageMagick) along with installing ApostropheCMS itself.

Then [create a new project](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/creating-your-first-project.html) on your computer and work on building your beautiful website.

The ApostropheCMS documentation will walk you through [editing page templates](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/editing-page-templates.html), [global content](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/global.html), [creating custom widgets](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/custom-widgets.html) and [navigation](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/building-navigation.html), along with [configuring reusable "pieces"](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/reusable-content-with-pieces.html) and [global settings](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/settings.html). Plus, a whole lot more!
