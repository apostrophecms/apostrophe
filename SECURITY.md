## Long term support (LTS)

Apostrophe 2.x was first released on September 3rd, 2016. It will be supported through 2023. Previous major versions no longer receive regular security patches, but we will accept code contributions for version 0.5

 Note that only stable LTS versions of Node.js (10.x and 12.x) are fully supported as well.
