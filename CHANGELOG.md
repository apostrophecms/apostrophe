# Changelog

## 2.114.0 (2021-01-13)
* Fixes image manager double-scroll bar bug.
* When a `styles` config with a single object is passed to an `apostrophe-rich-text` widget, use that as the defualt style. Thanks to [Fredrik Ekelund](https://github.com/fredrikekelund) for the contribution.

## 2.113.2 (2020-12-14)
* Hotfixes for Node 14 compatibility issues relating to watching template files for modification.
* Improvements to README.

## 2.113.1 (2020-11-04)
* Updates the logo in the README.

## 2.113.0 (2020-10-21)
* Remove published columns in apostrophe-users and apostrophe-groups, the modules where this field does not exist.
* Add `type` to forbiddenFields for apostrophe-pieces schemas. Thanks to [Jose96GIT](https://github.com/Jose96GIT) for the contribution. If you are using Apostrophe Workflow, you must be on `2.38.2` or later of that module because of this update.

## 2.112.1 (2020-10-07)
* When configuring columns in the pieces manager, the `listProjection` option was accidentally altered in a way that would impact other subclasses of pieces. This has been fixed.

## 2.112.0 (2020-10-02)

* Security: Apostrophe's oembed support has always consulted a list of safe sites, however the fallback support for embedding site previews via Open Graph did not consult such a list. There was no XSS risk, but this could be exploited to scan for open ports behind a firewall, and potentially to obtain title tags and page body text from webpages behind a firewall as well, if they had no login provisions. Note that this risk existed only if the public Apostrophe site was running on a server that could "see" these Intranet sites, which is rare (a public website is usually not hosted on an Intranet, port forwarding would typically be needed to make that possible). However to eliminate the risk our Open Graph fallback support now consults the same list of safe sites used for oembed. This Open Graph embed feature is not actually used by Apostrophe's video widgets, so this change will only impact developers who discovered the feature and chose to use it independently. If you are affected, add additional sites to the `safeList` option of `apostrophe-oembed`. For backwards compatibility the `whitelist` option is also accepted. Thanks to Rudi van Hierden for reporting the issue.

* Security: the `uploadfs` module has been updated. Since this is a sub-dependency you must `npm update` your Apostrophe project to get this update, which eliminates `npm audit` warnings regarding Google Cloud Storage. Note that after this update Google Cloud Storage can no longer be used with Apostrophe if your server is still running Node 8. Other storage backends still work with Node 8 as of this writing.

* Node 8 deprecation notice: for the time being, Apostrophe does still run on Node 8. However, since Node 8 has passed its end of life date, this support is unofficial and may be terminated soon. All projects should upgrade to a current Long Term Support version of Node.

* Clean up `fs.watch` calls from the nunjucks loader properly when destroying an `apos` object, so that the process can close and/or memory be recovered.

## 2.111.4 (2020-09-23)

* The `View File` button now accesses the original version of an image, not a scaled version. This was always the intention, but 2.x defaults to the `full` size and we initially missed it. Thanks to Quentin Mouraret for this contribution.
* LESS compilation errors during `apostrophe:generation` are now reported properly, resulting in a clean process exit. Previously they resulted in a hung process.

## 2.111.3 (2020-08-26)

* When Apostrophe is running behind a proxy server like nginx, you can now instruct it to trust the `X-Forwarded-*` headers by passing the `trustProxy: true` option to `apostrophe-express`. If Apostrophe is generating `http:` URLs when they should be `https:`, this is most likely what you need.

## 2.111.2 (2020-08-19)

* Fixed a conflict between `express.static` and apostrophe's automatic removal of trailing slashes from possible page URLs. Apostrophe's intent in using `express.static` is only to deliver static assets. So we have made that intent clear by disabling the `redirect` option of `express.static`, which attempts to add a trailing slash whenever a folder exists on disk by that name, resulting in an infinite redirect loop.

## 2.111.1 (2020-08-17)

* Fixed an incompatibility between apostrophe-workflow and MongoDB 4.4. Prior to version 4.4, MongoDB allowed a projection to contain both a parent property and one of its children, for instance `workflowLastCommitted` and `workflowLastCommitted.at`. Beginning with version 4.4 this causes an error, breaking the list view of pieces when workflow is present. For backwards compatibility, version 2.111.1 of Apostrophe now checks all projections coming from Apostrophe's cursors for this issue and removes the projection for the sub-property on the fly. This does not cause any compatibility issues of its own because projecting the parent always gives you the sub-property anyway.

## 2.111.0 (2020-08-12)

* By popular request, "Add Widget" dropdown menus are better organized now, with support for categories of widgets. You can configure this optional feature like so:

```
apos.area(data.page, 'areaNameHere', {
  widgets: { ... you must configure your widgets as usual ... }
  widgetGroups: {
    'Content': [ 'apostrophe-rich-text', 'apostrophe-images' ],
    'Layout': [ 'one-column', 'two-column' ]
  }
}
```

Every widget type you specify for `widgetGroups` must still be configured in `widgets`.

If `widgetGroups` is not present the "add widget" dropdown menu will appear as it always did.

* Removes the `aposBody` template macro, which was unused.

## 2.110.0 (2020-07-29)

* Security: added support for throttling login attempts. If you set the `throttle` option of `apostrophe-login` to `{ allowedAttempts: 3, perMinutes: 1, lockoutMinutes: 1 }`, a user will be locked out and unable to try again for 1 minute after three failed login attempts in 1 minute. Thanks to Michelin for making this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* Schemas: you may now set a regular expression to be used to validate any `string` schema field by setting the `pattern` property of the schema field. **Please note
that `pattern` must be a string,** not a regular expression literal. Otherwise it
will only be validated on the server side, causing confusion for the user when it
is not reported on the browser side. You may also set `patternErrorMessage` to
provide a clear explanation to the user when their input does not match. When
setting `pattern` as a string always remember to escape the `\` character properly
(you will often need two `\` characters, for instance `\\w`). To avoid Denial of Service attacks, take care to avoid [evil regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).
* Security: added an `apostrophe-login:before` promise event which is emitted with `(req)` before a login attempt is evaluated. If a handler throws a string as an error, that string is internationalized and displayed as a login error, otherwise login proceeds normally. This can be used to implement features like the new `apostrophe-login-recaptcha` module, which you can install separately.
* Security: to ease implementation of `apostrophe-login-recaptcha`, the login form now has `data-apos-login-form` and `data-apos-login-submit-button` attributes on the appropriate elements.
* Security: when requiring Google Authenticator or a similar app for login (TOTP), you may now limit the requirement to certain groups, by passing a setting like `totp: { groups: true }` to the `apostrophe-login` module rather than just `totp: true`. Admins may then select which groups actually require TOTP by selecting it when editing the group (look at the permissions tab). In addition, the existing `totp` option has been added to the module documentation.

## 2.109.0 (2020-07-15)

* Add [heic-to-jpeg-middleware](https://github.com/boutell/heic-to-jpeg-middleware) to support uploading `heic/heif` images (the standard format for recent iPhones/iPads). Many thanks to Gabriel L. Maljkovich for their contributions to the underlying middleware as well as the integration with Apostrophe.
* Add CSS to maintain spacing of admin UI.

## 2.108.1 (2020-07-01)

* Updates documentation of the `clonePermanent` utility method.
* The http response to dismissing a notification should not include any information about the mongodb connection. The response previously included relatively low-risk information, including the IP address of the MongoDB server but not enough to make an unauthorized connection when the MongoDB server and/or firewall are properly configured.

## 2.108.0 (2020-06-07)

* UX improvement: if a piece type has the `contextual: true` option set and workflow is present, do not default published to `false`. There is already a good opportunity to review before the public sees the piece afforded by workflow.

* If called with a scalar argument, `apos.utils.clonePermanent` now returns scalars (strings, booleans, numbers) as-is. This makes it easier to use the method when the argument might or might not be an object that requires cloning.

## 2.107.2 (2020-06-10)

* Fixed a regression that caused difficulty saving array fields with `color` subfields in their schema. This regression was introduced in 2.107.0.

## 2.107.1 (2020-06-03)

* The `distinctCounts` feature (also known as `counts: true` for `piecesFilters`) is now compatible with the `apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver` module, when in use. Note that there is little benefit to that module now that `emulate-mongo-2-driver` is standard in Apostrophe and employs the MongoDB 3.x driver under the hood but provides a 2.x-compatible API. However those who strongly prefer the 3.x driver APIs for direct MongoDB queries may use `apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver` with more confidence given this fix.

## 2.107.0 (2020-05-20)

* CKEditor has been updated to version 4.14, addressing a low-risk XSRF vulnerability. The vulnerability required that the source code editor feature be activated and that a user with editing privileges be convinced to import specially crafted markup, which is unlikely in practice.
* Users may now intentionally clear a `time` field, whether or not it has a `def` setting, in which case it is stored as `null` (unless `required: true` is present). The inability to do this was a regression introduced in version 2.102.0.
* Developers can now pass a `spectrumOptions` object to a `color` field and take full control of Spectrum, the plugin that powers Apostrophe's color picker. [Documentation for this configuration here.](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/reference/field-types/color.html#example)
* Activating the `objectNotation` option to `i18n` no longer causes problems for certain strings in Apostrophe's admin interface, which does not use it. You will see alternate Unicode characters for the `:` and `.` characters in these strings if you do choose to translate them. These are transformed back for end users.

## 2.106.3 (2020-05-06)

* Fixes a page tree interface bug that would cause pages to be lost when they
were trashed with their parent, then the parent was dragged out of the trash.
This only effected projects with `trashInSchema: true` set in the
`apostrophe-docs` module, however that includes anything using
`apostrophe-workflow`.

## 2.106.2 (2020-04-22)

* The icons of custom CKEditor plugins now appear properly. Previously they were hidden.
* Switched the continuous integration testing service to CircleCI from Travis.

## 2.106.1 (2020-04-20)

* Fixed a regression that broke the thumbnail display of images in "Manage Images." This regression was introduced in version 2.106.0, which was otherwise an important security update, so you should definitely update to 2.106.1 to get the benefit of that security fix if you haven't already.

## 2.106.0 (2020-04-17)

**Security:** the `list` route of the `apostrophe-pieces` module and the `info` route of the `apostrophe-pages` module formerly allowed site visitors to obtain the complete contents of publicly accessible pages and pieces. While there was no inappropriate access to documents that were unpublished, restricted to certain users, etc., properties not normally visible to end users were exposed. Since the global document can be fetched as part of requests made by the public, this means that any credentials in the schema of the global document are vulnerable to being viewed until your site is updated to at least Apostrophe 2.106.0. Note that if you are using Apostrophe Workflow you must also update that module to Apostrophe 2.34.0, otherwise the "Manage Workflow" view will not work.

The most important change made to resolve this issue is the use of a projection to populate the "Manage" view of pieces (the "list" route). While Apostrophe will automatically include any extra columns configured with `addColumns` in the projection, you may need to add additional properties to the projection if you have overridden the manage list view template entirely for some of your pieces to display additional information.

The easiest way to do that is to configure the `addToListProjection` option for your custom piece type, like so:

```javascript
// in lib/modules/my-module
module.exports = {
  extend: 'apostrophe-pieces',
  addToListProjection: {
    myExtraProperty: 1
  }
  // other configuration here as usual
}
```

You can also apply the `super` pattern to the new `getListProjection` method of `apostrophe-pieces`.

Many thanks to Kristian Mattila for bringing the issue to our attention, allowing us to patch the vulnerability
before any public disclosure was made. If you become aware of a security issue in Apostrophe, please contact
us via email at [security@apostrophecms.com](mailto:security@apostrophecms.com).

## 2.105.2 (2020-04-09)

* `apos.utils.emit` now works properly in IE11, addressing an issue that impacted `apostrophe-forms` submissions in IE11 in 2.105.0.
* IE11 now respects the `prefix` option properly in `apos.utils.get` and `apos.utils.post` (lean mode helpers for making API calls).

## 2.105.1 (2020-04-08)

* When using lean mode, video widgets did not support Internet Explorer 11. This issue has been fixed. Non-lean mode video widgets have always supported Internet Explorer 11.
* If the `jQuery: 3` option is not passed to `apostrophe-assets` a developer warning is now printed at startup. The use of jQuery 1.x is deprecated. All Apostrophe-published modules work fine with the `jQuery: 3` option. You may need to review the jQuery 3 changelogs for a few changes required for your own legacy code.
* Users may now intentionally clear a `date` field, whether or not it has a `def` setting, in which case it is stored as `null` (unless `required: true` is present). The inability to do this was a regression introduced in verion 2.102.0.
* The `objectNotation: true` option to `apostrophe-i18n`, which we pass on to the `i18n` module, is now compatible with the `namespaces: true` option. When both are active, the namespace separator defaults to `<@>` to avoid a conflict with the `:` character used to begin the default value when using object notation.
* Various documentation corrections and minor aesthetic improvements.

## 2.105.0 (2020-03-26)

* Security: Node 6.x has not been supported by its creators since April 2019, and Node 8.x reached its end of support date in December 2019. **As of this release of Apostrophe, we are officially acknowledging that it is not possible to maintain support for Node 6.x in Apostrophe and it is unlikely to work on that version,** since both the testing frameworks on which we rely and common sub-dependencies of essential open source modules used by Apostrophe now require Node 8 at a minimum. While we will make a good-faith effort to maintain Node 8.x usability as long as possible, we expect to similarly be forced to drop Node 8 compatibility soon. **Both Node 6 and Node 8 might not be safe to use for reasons entirely unrelated to Apostrophe**, so you should upgrade your servers as soon as practical. Few or no code changes should be needed in Apostrophe 2.x projects. **We strongly recommend moving to Node 12.x,** the most up to date LTS (Long-Term Support) release of Node. In the future, we recommend becoming familiar with the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) so you can better plan for such upgrades.
* Security: all of the recently new `npm audit` warnings were fixed. These were considered `low` risk according to the `npm audit` tool. In the process we removed dependencies on the `tar` and `prompt` modules in favor of simpler solutions with fewer moving parts.
* Lean mode: the `apos.utils.get` and `apos.utils.post` methods no longer prepend the site's global `prefix` when the call targets a different origin (another site's API, for instance). This is a bug fix to match the behavior of `$.jsonCall()` which set the standard for this in Apostrophe.
* Lean mode: `apos.utils.emit(el, name, data)` has been introduced. This method emits a custom DOM event with the given `name` and adds the properties of the `data` object to the event. The event is emitted on `el`. When emitting events with global significance, our convention is to emit them on `document.body`. To listen for such events one uses the standard browser method `document.body.addEventListener('eventname', function(event) { ... })`.
* Lean mode: `apos.utils.get` now emits an `apos-before-get` event with `uri`, `data` and `request` properties just before the request is actually sent. You may use this hook to add headers to `request`.
* Cloud deployment: when starting up a site with `APOS_BUNDLE=1`, the asset bundle is by default extracted to the root of the project so that the assets can be found in the filesystem of each server if needed. New feature: for the benefit of environments in which the bundle files are already present and the root of the project is not writable, `APOS_EXTRACT_BUNDLE=0` may now be set to disable the extraction (note `0`, not `1`).
* Localization: Apostrophe's static i18n of its user interface can now be "namespaced," opening the door to giving your translators better guidance on whether to translate it or ignore it when working with the JSON files in the `locales/` folder of your site. You can turn this on by enabling the `namespaces: true` option for the `apostrophe-i18n` module. When you do, Apostrophe's i18n phrases will be prefaced with `apostrophe<:>` in the JSON files (not in the browser). You can create your own namespaced translations by calling `__ns('namespacename', 'phrase')` rather than `__('phrase')`, `__ns_n` rather than `__n`, etc. Note that if the namespaces option is not actually turned on, these new helpers are still available in templates; they just don't prefix a namespace. The forthcoming `apostrophe-static-i18n` module, which allows for editing static translations as pieces, will also have an option to ignore a namespace, which is helpful if you wish to avoid showing our user interface phrases to your translation team at all.

## 2.104.0 (2020-03-11)

* `apos.utils.get` and `apos.utils.post` now return a promise if invoked without a callback. This means you may use `await` with them. *It is up to you to provide a `Promise` polyfill if you use this feature without callbacks and intend to support IE11. For instance you could use the `core-js` library.* These methods are similar to `$.get` and `$.post` but do not require jQuery. `apos.utils.post` supports Apostrophe's CSRF protection natively so you do not have to add an exception if you use it. These methods are available in [lean frontend mode](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/apostrophe/core-concepts/front-end-assets/lean-frontend-assets).
* `apos.utils.get` no longer adds an unnecessary `?` to the URL it fetches if `data` has no properties. In addition, `apos.utils.get` leaves the URL unchanged if `data` is null.
* Recursion warnings now include a hint to add a projection to pieces-widgets as well as more obvious joins.
* Dependencies updated to reflect latest version of `emulate-mongo-2-driver`, which contains an important fix to `count`.

## 2.103.1 (2020-03-04)

* An incompatibility with apostrophe-headless was introduced in Apostrophe 2.102.0. This version addresses that incompatibility, however you must also upgrade apostrophe-headless to version 2.9.3. The issue had to do with a change that was made to allow users to intentionally clear default values in forms. We are updating our regression test procedures to ensure that if a new release of apostrophe would break the unit tests of apostrophe-headless, it will not be published until that issue is resolved.

## 2.103.0 (2020-03-02)

* Frustrations with conflict resolution have been much improved. First, Apostrophe no longer displays the "another user has taken control of the document" message multiple times in a row. Second, due to changes in what browsers allow to happen when you leave the page, beginning in version 2.102.0 Apostrophe displayed too many messages about a conflict with your **own** work in another tab. We no longer display these messages. However, if there really *is* work lost for the same document in another tab, Apostrophe will still tell you what happened in order to teach the habit of not editing the same page in two tabs simultaneously.
* You may now use `select` schema field with dynamic choices as a filter in "Manage Pieces."
* `required` is now enforced on the server side for `joinByOne`. However, note that it is always possible for the document you joined with to be moved to the trash at a later time. You must therefore always check that the join was really loaded before relying on it. Thanks to Ricardo José Rodríguez Álvarez.
* Hidden information at the bottom of certain modals has been restored to view.

## 2.102.5 (2020-02-26)

* Explicitly require emulate-mongo-2-driver 1.2.1 or better, to address a bug in 1.2.0.

## 2.102.4 (2020-02-25)

* Explicitly require emulate-mongo-2-driver 1.2.0 or better, which provides a deprecation-free wrapper for `count` and fixes bugs in the wrapper for `aggregate`.

## 2.102.3 (2020-02-24)

* Security fix for [Prototype Override Protection Bypass vulnerability in the qs module](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:qs:20170213). It appears this risk only occurs when our `build` Nunjucks filter is used in conjunction with a URL based on what the browser sent, rather than starting with the `_url` property of the page and adding parameters to that with `build`, thus it is not an issue "out of the box" in all or most ApostropheCMS sites. However the vulnerability should be patched promptly because it could definitely exist in current or future project level code that uses `build`. To eliminate the risk, update to this version of Apostrophe and make sure you "npm update" to get the required updated version of `qs` via Apostrophe's dependencies.

* This version also corrects a bug that prevented the recently released disableInactiveAccounts feature from working.

## 2.102.2 (2020-02-11)

* Removed the restriction preventing the use of `mongodb+srv` connection
URIs with MongoDB. `emulate-mongo-2-driver` has no problem with these, since
it passes them on to the 3.x driver.
* Updated dependency to `emulate-mongo-2-driver` 1.1.0, which knocks out 100% of the common MongoDB deprecation warnings when using Apostrophe, with one exception: you should set the `useUnifiedTopology: true` option yourself. We do not do this for you because we cannot break legacy configurations using other topologies. However most of you can just turn this option on and enjoy more reliable connections and no more warnings.

Here is how to configure that in Apostrophe:

```javascript
// in app.js, where your modules key is...
modules: {
  'apostrophe-db': {
    connect: {
      useUnifiedTopology: true
    }
  }
}
```

## 2.102.1 (2020-02-10)

* Temporarily pinned to `less` version 3.10.x to work around an
[upstream bug](https://github.com/less/less.js/issues/3469) that broke
deployments.

## 2.102.0 (2020-01-30)

* Apostrophe now displays "Saving... Saved" indicators near the context
menu in the lower left indicator. In our UX tests, users often did not
realize Apostrophe automatically saved their work and were concerned
by the lack of an explicit save button. In addition, Apostrophe no longer
attempts to save your remaining changes via a synchronous HTTP request when you
close the page, because this is deprecated in all browsers and disabled
in many. Instead, Apostrophe uses the standard "you have unsaved changes,
are you sure you wish to leave this page?" dialog. Together with the
"saving... saved" indicator, this provides a mechanism for preventing
lost work that is robust in modern browsers.

This does impact Apostrophe's "advisory locking" mechanism that warns users
if another user is already editing. Since we cannot guarantee a synchronous
request to unlock the page will ever be received, we have instead
shortened the expiration time for document locks to 30 seconds. Since
these are refreshed every 5 seconds there should be no negative impacts
in typical use.

Thanks to Freshworks for making this improvement possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

* New `disableInactiveAccounts` option, which can be set like so:
```javascript
  'apostrophe-users': {
    disableInactiveAccounts: true
  }
```

By default, users from the "admin" group are whitelisted and the inactivity period is 90 days. This can be changed:

```javascript
{
  // in your project level lib/modules/apostrophe-users/index.js file
  disableInactiveAccounts: {
    neverDisabledGroups: [ 'test', 'otherGroup' ],
    // After 30 days without logging in, the account is marked disabled
    // on next login attempt, until an admin explicitly enables it again
    inactivityDuration: 30
  }
}
```

* A longstanding bug relating to schemas has been fixed. Previously, if you attempted to clear a string field that had a `def` property, that field would be repopulated with the `def` value. This was never intended; `def` is only for the initial population of a newly created object. If you were relying on this bug, update your code to use `apos.schemas.newInstance(schema)` from the start so that you begin with an object that has the right defaults for each field. Note that pieces, pages, etc. already do this.

* Added a `bodyAttributes` block to `outerLayoutBase.html`. You may override this block to add new attributes to `body` without overriding the entire `outerLayoutBase.html` template. It is a best practice to not override this template, use the provided blocks.

* Fields of type `attachment` with `required` not set to `true` now work properly.

* You may now set the `loginUrl` option of the `apostrophe-login` module to change the login URL from `/login` to something else. Thanks to Giuseppe Monteleone for this contribution.

* `help` property is now supported for array fields.

* Uploads with a capitalized file extension are now accepted where appropriate. Thanks to Fernando Figaroli for this contribution.

* When editing a join with pages, a nonfunctional edit pencil icon is no longer displayed. Actual inline editing of page settings from another page may be a 3.0 feature.

## 2.101.1 (2020-01-08)

* Dependency on `emulate-mongo-2-driver` is now explicitly set to require at least version 1.0.3 to bring in various fixes.
* Reported `landscape` and `portrait` properties of an image attachment object now correspond to the crop in use, if any.

## 2.101.0 (2019-12-14)

* Due to `npm audit` security vulnerability warnings and the end of upstream support, the 2.x version of the `mongodb` npm module (the driver we used to connect to MongoDB, not MongoDB itself) can no longer be responsibly used in Apostrophe. Therefore we have replaced it with the new [emulate-mongo-2-driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emulate-mongo-2-driver) module, which strives to match the interface of the MongoDB driver version 2.x while acting as a wrapper for the official, supported MongoDB driver version 3.x. This has been tested in many projects. Therefore no code changes should be required for your project to `npm update` to version 2.101.0. However if you encounter incompatibilities, most likely in driver features not used in Apostrophe, please [contribute additional wrappers and test coverage to emulate-mongo-2-driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emulate-mongo-2-driver). Another option is to use [apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver), which allows you to use the 3.x driver API directly and also provides a `findWithProjection` collection method as a migration path for quickly patching legacy code.
* The `def` property of schema fields associated with specific page types is now displayed in the editor when creating new pages. Thanks to Michelin for making this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* A schema field named `fields` can now be included in a projection without surprising behavior.
* EPS (`.eps`) files are now accepted as Apostrophe attachments and categorized in the `office` group, meaning they can be uploaded as "files."
* The `aspectRatio` option, when specified directly for attachment schema field properties, now implies permission to crop as forced center-cropping differed from what we do when applying aspect ratios to image widgets.
* Cross-browser fix for the back button when using our page-refresh-free AJAX features for browsing pieces. Thanks to sergiodop92 for this fix.

## 2.100.3 (2019-12-03)

* The `aspectRatio` option to the `attachments` schema field type is now fully implemented. We always had this for selecting images, e.g. in our `apostrophe-images-widgets` module, but it is now also available when directly using an `attachment` schema field as a property of your own doc. You can also set `crop: true` to allow manual cropping in that case. This is a useful technique when including the image in a reusable media library does not make sense.

## 2.100.2 (2019-12-02)

* Corrected a significant performance problem with the `apostrophe-users:add` command line task when thousands of users exist.

## 2.100.1 (2019-11-21)

* Must confirm when resetting password, since there are no do-overs if we do not have the email confirmation method available (with `resetLegacyPassword: true`) and since it's generally a pain not to have this.
* Fixed the "Reset TOTP authentication" feature of "Manage Users".

## 2.100.0 (2019-11-21)

* New feature: Google Authenticator two-factor authentication (TOTP) support for Apostrophe accounts. Set the `totp: true` option of the `apostrophe-login` module. When enabled, users (including admins) are required to set up and complete authentication with Google Authenticator or a compatible TOTP app on their mobile device. On the user's next login they set up Google Authenticator; after that they must supply a code from Google Authenticator at each login. If a user loses their device, an admin can reset their access by editing that user via "Manage Users" and selecting "Reset TOTP 2-Factor Authentication." If the admin loses their device, they can use the new `apostrophe-users:reset-totp` command line task. Thanks to Michelin for making this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* New feature: `resetLegacyPassword: true` option for `apostrophe-login`. When the `passwordRules` and `passwordMinLength` options are present, enabling `resetLegacyPassword` permits the user to change their password right away at login time if it is correct, but does not meet your new standards for adequate passwords. This does not require receiving a confirmation email; if you are concerned by that, consider enabling `passwordReset` instead if you are willing to [configure email delivery](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/apostrophe/tutorials/howtos/email). Thanks to Michelin for making this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* New feature: `resetKnownPassword: true` option for `apostrophe-login`. When enabled, a currently logged-in user is permitted to change their own password without receiving an email, as long as they know their current password. This adds an additional admin bar item, which you may want to group. Thanks to Michelin for making this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* Performance: Apostrophe is now much faster when editing a piece with hundreds of areas in its schema. Thanks to Bharathkumar Chandrasekaran of Freshworks for his contributions to finding the solution.
* Bug fix: `passwordRules` and `passwordMinLength` no longer break support for new users created via `apostrophe-passport` who use single sign-on and do not have explicit passwords in Apostrophe.
* Developer warning: a module that implements a widget must have a name ending in `-widgets` or the editor will not work properly in the browser. We now display a warning.
* Developer warning: if the developer tries to configure `piecesFilters` for the pieces module, rather than the corresponding pieces-pages module, a warning is displayed.
* UI fix: modal dialog box height corrected. Thanks to Paul Grieselhuber for this contribution.
* UI fix: better Microsoft Edge support. Thanks to Denis Lysenko.

## 2.99.0 (2019-10-30)

* Optional password complexity rules. You may set `passwordMinLength` to a number of your choice. You may also set `passwordRules` to an array of rule names. Those available by default are `noSlashes`, `noSpaces`, `mixedCase`, `digits`, and `noTripleRepeats`. To block **existing** passwords that don't meet this standard, you should also set `passwordRulesAtLoginTime: true`. Additional password rules may be registered by calling `apos.login.addPasswordRule('name', { test: fn, message: 'error message' })`. The function will receive the password and must return `true` if it is acceptable. Thanks to Michelin for making this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* `apos.utils.attachmentUrl` has been added to lean mode. It works exactly like `apos.attachments.url`, which is not available in lean mode, with one exception: to avoid adding more overhead to lean mode, the default size is the original. So you must take care to specify the `size` option for performance when working with images.
* When an in-page edit is made and an area is updated as a result, the `update` method of the appropriate module is now called, rather than `apos.docs.update`. This allows for `beforeSave`, etc. to fire in this situation. Thanks to Kalia Martin of swiss4ward for this contribution.
* Apostrophe now provides a `res.rawRedirect` method, which performs a redirect without adding the sitewide prefix. On sites without a prefix it is equivalent to `res.redirect`. This is useful when working with a URL that is already prefixed, such as the `_url` property of a page or piece.
* Using the `groups` option to `apostrophe-users` together with a very large database can lead to slow startup because the groups are found by title, and title is not an indexed field. You may now specify the `slug` for each group in the array, in which case they are found by `slug` instead, which is an optimized query. However most very large sites would be better off removing the `groups` option and allowing groups to be managed flexibly via the admin bar.
* `apos.tasks.getReq` now provides more simulated i18n support.
* The occasional but irritating "not blessed" bug when editing content on the page has been fixed via a new "reinforced blessing" mechanism.

## 2.98.1 (2019-10-21)

* When selecting pages for a join, you are now permitted to choose any page you have access to view. This was never intended to be locked down to pages you can edit. For instance, you should be able to link to any page you can see when editing a navigation widget. Thanks to Freshworks for making this fix possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* Beginning with this version we are whitelisting `npm audit` advisories that are not relevant to Apostrophe. Specifically, advisory `1203` has no bearing on Apostrophe because end users cannot specify collection names to MongoDB via Apostrophe.

## 2.98.0 (2019-10-11)

* Bug fix: the `sendPage` method now emits the `apostrophe-pages:beforeSend` promise event no matter which module is calling `self.sendPage`. This was always the intention, as shown by the fact that the legacy `pageBeforeSend` method is called. The purpose of `sendPage` has always been to allow a custom route to render a page exactly as Apostrophe normally does, and that includes calling all `apostrophe-pages:beforeSend` handlers.
* Bug fix: the `title` field is now required in the `apostrophe-users` module. Thanks to Jose Garcia of swiss4ward.
* The `apostrophe-templates` module now has an internal `i18n` method intended to be overridden by those who want to monitor and/or alter static internationalization results. This will be used by the forthcoming `apostrophe-i18n-debugger` module. You don't need to call this method, you can use the standard [i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n) helpers.

## 2.97.2 (2019-10-03)

* All [i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n) helpers are now available in templates, not just the `__` helper. See the [i18n module documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n) for more information. Test coverage was added to ensure this remains in place.
* UX improvements in "reorganize" (Manage Pages).
* contributing.md now points to the [apostrophecms Discord chat community](https://chat.apostrophecms.org) for live community help, rather than Gitter, which has been retired.

## 2.97.1 (2019-09-26)

* Hotfix for a potential Denial Of Service issue reported by NPM. A user with login privileges could eventually exhaust available memory by submitting thousands of batch job requests.

## 2.97.0 (2019-09-25)

* The simplified `APOS_BUNDLE=1` feature for asset deployment in the cloud now uses the actual `tar` utility when extracting assets locally, rather than the `tar` npm module, as a blocking bug was encountered and the actual utility is faster.
* Improved support for subclasses of `apostrophe-rich-text-widgets`. These now receive the same CSS UX considerations and store their content under the appropriate widget name. This opens the door to the new `tiptap` option offered by the latest release of [apostrophe-tiptap-rich-text-widgets](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-tiptap-rich-text-widgets), which can be used to selectively enable or disable the use of tiptap as an alternative to CKEditor for some subclasses but not others.
* Low-level support for namespacing asset themes. By default this has no effect, however if getThemeName is overridden to return a theme name then asset masters, minified assets, bundles in the collection, etc. all get namespaced to play side by side with other themes used by other apos objects in the same project. Meant for use with apostrophe-multisite, this is not equivalent to a Wordpress or Drupal theme as such.
* The widget editor's `afterShow` method takes no callback; removed an invocation that did not make sense. Thanks to Amin Shazrin for this contribution.
* Improved sizing for video widgets. This is now based on the parent element. Also added empty alt tag to the placeholder image as a hint not to read it aloud.

Thanks to Michelin for making much of this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.96.2 (2019-09-17)

* Bug fix: missing required fields nested in `array` or `object` fields hidden fvia `showFields` no longer result in a server-side error. They adhere to the usual rule that if you can't see it, you're not expected to enter it.
* Bug fix: autocomplete now works again for tags and joins. This was caused by a difference of z-index introduced by an upgrade of jQuery UI in July.
* Better UX for drag and drop.
* The `findTestModule` method now works properly in Windows, opening the door to testing Apostrophe modules more easily on Windows. Thanks to Amin Shazrin for this contribution.
* The base name of the master stylesheet has been factored out to a `getStylesheetsMasterBase` method in `apostrophe-assets`, for easier overrides in multisite projects.
* Thanks to refactoring of the implementation, it is now possible to override the behavior of the `apostrophe-email` module to use different transports in different circumstances. Thanks to Aurélien Wolz for this contribution.

## 2.96.1 (2019-09-09)

* Setting PORT to `0`, or passing `0` as the `port` option to `apostrophe-express`, now works per the TCP documentation: you get a random port number. You can access that port number as `apos.modules['apostrophe-express'].port`. Thanks to J. Garijo for this contribution.
* The ability to add a new image while selecting one for a widget has been restored. Similar scenarios while editing other joins are also fixed.
* Double-clicking the "Edit" button of a widget no longer causes a race condition. Thanks to Mayank Bansal for pointing out the issue and how to reproduce it.
* Undisplayed tooltips no longer take up space in a way that causes interface frustration.

## 2.96.0 (2019-09-04)

* Reverse joins no longer result in an empty tab when they are the only unarranged field, since they have no editing UI in any case.
* The "context menu" (aka "Page Settings," "Published," etc.) has been cleaned up in several ways. It no longer appears unless the user at least has edit access to either `data.page` or `data.piece`. This deciding factor can be altered by overriding `apos.templates.showContextMenu`, which accepts `req` and must return `true` or `false`. In addition, the "Unpublished" dropdown works properly in all cases.
* Notifications now have an explicit "close" button to help those who did not realize they were clickable. Also, they display the proper cursor when hovered and use a suitable HTML tag for improved accessibility.

## 2.95.1 (2019-09-01)

* Drag and drop operations within an area, and various other operations, no longer result in a race condition where the same document is locked more than once and content can be lost. This is especially noticeable on slower connections but can happen anytime. This was a longstanding problem. Thanks to Eric Wong for his patient reporting and testing of this issue.
* eslint has been updated, addressing npm audit complaints.

## 2.95.0 (2019-08-21)

* Nested content in sub-areas is no longer lost when editing schema properties of the widget that contains the areas.
* The `slugPrefix` option for pieces modules now works correctly. This option prefixes the slugs of all pieces of that type with the given string. It is recommended, but not required, that the prefix end in `-`. The editor requires that the slug be prefixed with the `slugPrefix`, the editor suggests slugs that include the prefix, and a migration now runs to add the `slugPrefix` to pieces that lack the prefix. If this results in a slug conflict the offending piece is left alone and flagged for your manual attention. A slug without the prefix does not cause any harm, other than cluttering up the namespace of slugs.
* `apostrophe-images` and `apostrophe-files` now use the `slugPrefix` option to prefix their slugs. This will result in a **one-time** migration for each at startup, after which your image and file slugs will no longer be in frequent conflict with other pieces when you try to give them friendly slugs. Note that **image and file slugs are not used in actual media asset filenames**, so there is no bc break there. And although most sites don't have an `apostrophe-images-pages` or `apostrophe-files-pages` module, those that do will experience no 404 errors due to Apostrophe's robust redirect features.
* Apostrophe migrations are now more stable in MongoDB Atlas and other environments in which it is unwise to keep a single MongoDB cursor alive for long periods. To achieve greater stability, the `apos.migrations.eachDoc` method now fetches the `_id` properties of all relevant docs first, and they are then processed in small batches.
* The `APOS_TRACE_DB=1` environment variable, which is useful for tracking down MongoDB issues, now includes traces for `distinct` calls.
* A division-by-zero error in the migration progress display was fixed, correcting some strange-looking output.
* In `apostrophe-assets`, the logic to determine the dev environment asset generation id was factored out to the `determineDevGeneration` method to simplify overriding it in `apostrophe-multisite`.
* `apos.utils.post` and `apos.utils.get` now report HTTP errors (status >= 400) properly to their callbacks. The object provided as the error includes a `status` property with the HTTP status code. The body is still available in the second argument to the callback.

## 2.94.1 (2019-08-12)

* Bug fix for a regression that impacted the ability to edit an array field again after cancelling the first time. Thanks to Amin Shazrin for this contribution.

## 2.94.0 (2019-08-09)

* Bug fix for the new simplified static asset bundling: URLs beginning with `/` in CSS files are correctly rewritten to point to the bundle in the cloud when using the simple bundle feature (`APOS_BUNDLE=1`). This was already done for the old method.
* In the browser, the lean methods `apos.utils.post` and `apos.utils.get` now accept non-JSON responses from APIs. To maximize bc, if the response has the `application/json` content type, it is always parsed for you; if not, it is still parsed for you if it is valid JSON, but otherwise it is delivered to you as-is (as a string).
* When you edit the slug of a piece or page manually and a slug conflict with another piece or page is created, you can now optionally click a button in order to edit the conflicting piece or page, and change its slug to eliminate the conflict.

## 2.93.0 (2019-07-25)

* New, simplified static asset bundling feature for deploying to cloud hosts like Heroku. See the [ApostropheCMS Heroku HOWTO](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/apostrophe/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud-with-heroku) for details. There is more to successful Heroku deployment than just static assert bundling.

First, make sure the `APOS_BUNDLE=1` environment variable is set in your production environment, i.e. in your Heroku environment settings.

Next, set up a ["release tasks" script](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase):

```
# Remember, APOS_BUNDLE=1 must be set globally in your Heroku
# environment settings already - not just this script but also
# the regular dyno startup must see it

node app apostrophe:generation
node app apostrophe-migrations:migrate
```

And that's all you have to do! No more creating named bundles and committing them to git. That technique still works, but it is much more work for you.

This new method does require that the release tasks script have access to the production database, as MongoDB is used to store the bundle until the Heroku dynos have a chance to unpack it locally.

> Due to the temporary storage of the bundle in MongoDB, if your asset bundle is larger than 16MB this technique will not work... and your users will be miserable, waiting for a 16MB asset bundle to download on their phones! So please, just don't push that much code to the browser. If you must though, you can use the old technique.

Again, see the [ApostropheCMS Heroku HOWTO](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/apostrophe/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud-with-heroku) for details. There is more to successful Heroku deployment than just static assert bundling, most importantly you need to use S3 for media storage.

* In the lean library (`apos.utils.post`), use the csrf-fallback value for the csrf token if there is no csrf cookie name, same as the regular jquery library would. This achieves compatibility with the `disableAnonSessions: true` option of `apostrophe-express`.

* When copying the permissions of a parent page to subpages, you now have the option to append them rather than replacing all existing permissions. Thanks to Siddharth Joshi.

## 2.92.1 (2019-07-09)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Fixes for several bugs relating to tooltips persisting on the page longer than they should.
* Fixes for three bugs relating to array fields: a `required` array field that is hidden by `showFields` is now correctly treated as not required (like other fields). Clicking "cancel" when editing an array now correctly reverts to the original contents of the array. And dynamic choice methods for `select` and `checkboxes` fields now work correctly when nested in an `array` or `object` field.
* Nested areas can now be edited properly when found inside a dialog box, such as the "Edit" dialog box of a piece type.
* Upgraded `diff` package to continue passing `npm audit`.
* Upgraded `jQuery` from version 3.3.1 to version 3.4.1, for those who have set `jQuery: 3` as an option to `apostrophe-assets`. This addresses a minor prototype pollution bug in jQuery. Please note that if you are not using `jQuery: 3`, you are still using jQuery 1.x. If you have jQuery code that will not work with 3.x, you should take the plunge and fix it, as there are no new fixes forthcoming for any issues with jQuery 1.x. You can also use the new `lean: true` option to eliminate jQuery altogether when no user is logged in (in Apostrophe 3.x this will be the behavior all the time).

## 2.92.0 (2019-06-26)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Bug fix: an open redirect vulnerability has been fixed. It was possible to convince Apostrophe to redirect to a third-party website by appending an escaped URL with a trailing slash added at the end. Apostrophe's trailing-slash remover would then cause a redirect to the un-escaped version of the slug part of the URL. The fix removes all multiple-slash sequences from the slug part of the URL. Thanks to Bharath for reporting this issue.
* Bug fix: attempting to save a doc with a `required` `array` field without ever opening the array editor formerly caused strange behavior. You now get a standard indication that the field is required.
* Feature: the method that supplies the choices for a dynamic `select` element may be a simple synchronous function, if desired. Formerly returning a promise (or using an async function) was mandatory.
* Feature: `apos.utils.post` will now accept a `FormData` object as the `data` prameter. In this situation JSON encoding is not used. This may be used to easily submit file uploads with Apostrophe's CSRF protection and is supported at least back to IE11.

## 2.91.1 (2019-06-05)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Bug fix: the `apos.utils.post` method introduced in version 2.90.0 now correctly submits the CSRF header.

## 2.91.0 (2019-06-05)

* Feature: it is much easier to write sites with **no jQuery, lodash, etc.** on the front end. The `apostrophe-lean-frontend` module has been deprecated and its functionality has been merged into the core. All of the functionality of the `apos.lean` object is now available on the `apos.utils` object at all times. And if you set the `lean: true` option for the `apostrophe-assets` module, **only lean JavaScript is pushed** when logged out (assets pushed with `when: 'lean'`, including the lean methods of `apos.utils`). This creates a migration path to a leaner frontend: developers can write NPM modules that rely only the lean `apos.utils` methods without worrying about whether they are present or not. Note that this is also the official frontend library for the forthcoming Apostrophe 3.x (Of course, as always, you can choose to push more code, use webpack, etc.)
* Bug fix: a regression introduced in 2.90.0 caused all uses of "Copy Page" to copy the home page. This is fixed.
* Bug fix: copying a page with custom fields now copies those fields properly.
* Bug fix: "Copy Page" now correctly copies parked page fields to the new, unparked page and then allows them to be edited for the new page.
* Bug fix: addressed browser errors that occurred when using an empty rich text toolbar. Unfortunately it is not possible to completely eliminate the ckeditor 4 toolbar when there are no tools present. This is due to a ckeditor bug.

Thanks to Michelin for making much of this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.90.0 (2019-05-23)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* New feature: `select` schema fields now support dynamic choices. To use this feature, set `choices` to the name of a method of your module. Apostrophe will invoke that method on the fly to get the choices. Your method receives `(req)` and must return an array of choices. **Your method can be an `async` function, or return a promise for the choices array.** This means you can contact external APIs to obtain the choices. The choices array is in the same format as ever (objects with `label` and `value` properties). Note that if you just want to choose Apostrophe objects of various types, there is a better way: use `joinByOne` or `joinByArray` fields. Fields with dynamic choices do not support the `showFields` option.
* New feature: `checkboxes` schema fields also support dynamic choices. The syntax is exactly the same as above. This allows multiple selection.
* New feature: any `select` or `checkboxes` field in the schema of a widget can be moved to a compact select element that appears "in context" on the page, among the widget's controls. To do that, just set `widgetControls: true` in the schema field definition. If you wish, you can also set `contextual: true` so that the field no longer appears in the schema's editing dialog box. By default the field appears in both places. For space reasons, the interface for `checkboxes` is also powered by a select element, but you can add multiple choices by selecting the dropdown more than once. Each time you make a change via one of these fields, the widget is refreshed to show the impact of the change. **You may use dynamic choices as described above.**
* New feature: the `viewsFolderFallback` option to `apostrophe-templates` may now be an array. Thanks to Amin Shazrin.
* New feature: help has been added to the video widget explaining that what is needed is a URL to a YouTube or other oEmbed-friendly video.
* New feature: you may now specify `htmlHelp` as a schema field option if you want to include simple markup, like links. The existing `help` option expects plaintext and escapes accordingly.
* New feature: the `req` objects returned by `apos.tasks.getReq` and `apos.tasks.getAnonReq` now include a `session` object for broader compatibility with methods that expect a proper `req`. It is a plain object and does not remember anything beyond the lifetime of the `req`.
* Bug fix: copying the "Home" page works properly.
* Bug fix: the Apostrophe migrations progress meter no longer crashes if the operation reports more steps than the expected total.
* Bug fix: watch all inlined stylesheets for changes, not just those implicitly inlined due to the use of the `css` extension when pushing them.
* Bug fix: improved clearing of tooltips. Addresses various situations where a tooltip could linger on the screen.
* Developer warnings: warning at startup if your module tries to use "extends" rather than "extend" to extend another module.
* Developer warnings: warning at startup if your module attempts to "extend" `apostrophe-assets` or one of a few other core modules that are normally singletons, and probably should not ever have a competing instance under another name. Advice is given to write project level code for the module without `extend`, or to use `improve` when enhancing it via an npm module.

## 2.89.1 (2019-05-13)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* `getSchemaOptions` method no longer throws inappropriate errors when the alternate form of `apos.area` or `apos.singleton` is used. Bug introduced in 2.89.0.
* The CSRF cookie is once again always reset on each request, to ensure no discrepancy between the session (and session cookie) lifespan and the CSRF cookie lifespan. This does not force sessions to exist unnecessarily, it just ensures CSRF errors do not mysteriously begin to appear in long-idle sessions, or when making cross-domain locale switches via the editing interface in apostrophe-workflow.
* Edits to raw .css files once again trigger less-middleware to recognize a change has occurred and avoid sending a stale cached file in development. When `.css` (rather than `.less`) assets are pushed inline, which is necessary to match the behavior we formerly received from clean-css and avoid crashes on CSS that the LESS parser cannot handle, we now monitor them for changes ourselves and "touch" the master LESS file to help the `less-middleware` module figure out that they have been changed.

## 2.89.0 (2019-05-01)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Many significant improvements to make crashes and restarts less likely.
* The most frequently used methods now sanity-check their arguments and invoke their callback, or as appropriate, if they are not valid. This replaces many full-process crashes with polite 500 errors.
* New, safer and easier alternatives to `self.route`:
  * `self.apiRoute`, which accepts a `next` function that can be passed either an error, or `(null, value)`, where `value` is an object to be sent to the browser with a `status: 'ok'` property automatically added — the convention for APIs in Apostrophe 2.x. In addition, errors reported to `next` are converted to `status` properties and/or logged gracefully, including more complete information about where the error took place for easier debugging. Most core routes have been refactored to use it. This approach extends Express 4.0's concept of error handlers with the ability to handle success as well. You can still use `res` if you need to, for instance to issue a redirect.
  * `self.renderRoute`, which accepts a `next` function that can be passed either an error that will be mapped to an appropriate HTTP status code, or `(null, { template: 'templateName', data: { ... props for the template ... })`. The named template is rendered with `self.render`, and any exceptions thrown are caught properly and logged as errors without a process crash — unlike what frequently happened before in such routes.
  * `self.htmlRoute`, similar to renderRoute but it does not render the markup for you; instead you pass markup as the second argument to `next()`. Useful if you are rendering by some means other than `self.render`.
* For template errors, a great deal of redundant error logging has been removed.
* Introduced `apos.utils.warnDevOnce`, refactored some existing warnings to use it, and added a call for CSRF errors to help developers understand what these mean.
* New trace feature to help debug crashes in Apostrophe's startup process. Try: `APOS_TRACE_STARTUP=1 node app`

## 2.88.1 (2019-04-25)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Fix: widgets are not lost when dragged to a different area.
* Fix: widgets are not duplicated when dragged to a different area.
* Fix: area save operations now use a lock to avoid lost information if several requests are made simultaneously for different areas, as can happen when dragging a widget between areas, which modifies both.
* Fix: widgets can be edited again after being dragged, without a page refresh.
* Fix: the "purple screen of death" error page now has a 500 status code, not 200.

## 2.88.0 (2019-04-23)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* An optional improvement to eliminate the use of session storage for most site visitors. By default, Apostrophe creates a session for every site visitor, even an anonymous visitor, to provide full CSRF protection. You may now optionally disable this for anonymous visitors:

```javascript
modules: {
  'apostrophe-express': {
    csrf: {
      disableAnonSession: true
    }
  }
}
```

When you do this, anonymous visitors receive only basic CSRF protection based on a known header value and the fact that the Same Origin Policy does not allow requests to be made by JavaScript unless the page is on the proper site.

For performance reasons the largest sites will likely find this to be a valuable option.

* `apos.global.findGlobal` now officially supports returning a promise. This was an unofficial side effect in earlier releases that ceased to work in recent releases.

* Updated the version of `moment` that ships on the front end to the latest minor release.

* Eliminated unnecessary arrangeFields warnings. `apostrophe-groups` is set up properly, the `trash` field no longer generates warnings when workflow is active, and reverse joins no longer generate warnings as they have no editing UI.

* `null` values were able to crash the schema converters for strings, integers and floats when those fields were `required`. This has been fixed.

## 2.87.0 (2019-04-10)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Tooltips have been added to improve the editor experience. For instance, tooltips appear on hover for the "up," "down," "clone" and "trash" buttons when working with areas.
* Building on the performance work in version 2.86.0, all `ensureIndex` calls have been moved to the `migrate` startup phase and can thus be skipped with `APOS_NO_MIGRATE=1`. Note that as with the other recent changes, this means that if your site is *always* run with `APOS_NO_MIGRATE=1`, including at the time the database is created, it is imperative that you run `node app apostrophe-migrations:migrate` at least once. If your database starts out in a dev environment and is later moved to a production environment, or you use stagecoach or a similar deployment tool that guarantees migrations are run on all code deployments (and you should definitely do that), then this will not be an issue.
* Building on the support for namespaced npm modules as apostrophe modules added in 2.86.0, the `testModule: true` flag used to test apostrophe in the context of an npm module like `apostrophe-workflow` can now be used in a namespaced npm module. Thanks to Aurélien Wolz for this contribution.

## 2.86.0 (2019-04-03)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Apostrophe now supports namespaced NPM modules as apostrophe modules. This allows NPM private modules to be used to deliver, for instance, an apostrophe piece type, page type or widget type. Here is an example of valid configuration:

```javascript
require('apostrophe', {
  modules: {
    // ordinary npm module
    'apostrophe-blog': {},
    // namespaced npm module
    '@somenamespace/somemodule': {}
  }
}
```

```javascript
// in lib/modules/@somenamespace/somemodule/index.js
module.exports = {
  nifty: true
};
```

* In addition, modules may be namespaced NPM-style inside a [bundle](https://docs.apostrophecms.org/apostrophe/other/more-modules#packaging-apostrophe-modules-together-creating-bundles). You will need to use a subdirectory structure, as seen above. As a best practice, you should only use this for module names you would have to publish to npm if the bundle feature did not exist. The "lead module" of the bundle should be in the same npm namespace.
* If you are using the `partial` feature of `addColumn` with your pieces, you can now accept `piece` as a second argument. For bc, the value of that particular column property is still the first argument.
* All of Apostrophe's "sanity-checking" database operations at startup, plus all Apostrophe migrations, now execute during a new `migrate` startup phase. This phase emits the `apostrophe:migrate` promise event. This phase occurs immediately after `afterInit` is invoked for modules, but before it is invoked for the global `afterInit` hook, if any. This change ensures there is a "sane" database before any interaction with the site takes place, and means that developers no longer have to remember to run `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` when upgrading during development.
* You can also suppress these database operations at startup completely by setting the `APOS_NO_MIGRATE` environment variable to `1`, or by passing the `migrate: false` top-level option to Apostrophe. In this case, these operations all occur only when the `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` command line task is run. This option saves a great deal of startup time for the enterprise customers with the largest databases. Thus the best practice in production is the same as ever: run `node app apostrophe-migrations:migrate` before launching the new version of the app. In addition, you may set `APOS_NO_MIGRATE=1` in your production environment to save valuable startup time, especially during process restarts, etc.
* Apostrophe now always instructs `less` to import CSS (not LESS) files `inline`. This is necessary because CleanCSS, which we no longer use, formerly automatically did it and without it import paths are incorrect. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund for this fix.
* UX improvement: if you edit a page, then follow a link from that page, and then click the "back" button, you should see your changes intact without the need to click "Refresh" thanks to the use of cachebusting headers. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund for recommending an approach to the problem.
* Bug fix: if your site startup or migration task invokes multiple time-consuming operations you'll now see a progress meter for each one, not just the first.
* To save space and make sure developers don't just tune out, the warning about fields not properly arranged into tabs now appears at startup just for the first such module, unless you pass `--all-unarranged-fields` to get more information.

Thanks to Michelin for making many of these features possible through [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.85.0 (2019-03-27)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* If a JPEG file has EXIF data such as the description, credit, etc. this information is
now copied into new properties of the attachment field and made available automatically
on corresponding new schema properties of `apostrophe-images` pieces.
* `req.data.global` now becomes available even before its joins and area loaders are
executed, as `req.aposGlobalCore`. This allows modules such as `apostrophe-pieces-orderings-bundle` to avoid recursive scenarios and performance problems.
* Sortable columns in the manage view can now indicate whether the first click sorts forwards
or backwards, simply by specifying the sort direction in the usual MongoDB way with `1` or
`-1`.
* Sortable columns can now be toggled from "no sort" to "forward" to "backward" and back to "no sort" again, and the hover state indicates all of these "next" states.
* The `limitByAll` and `limitByTag` options of the `apostrophe-pieces-widgets` module now correctly remove these fields from the `showFields` of the select element that chooses how the widget will select content to display.
* To select many consecutive pieces or pages quickly in the "Manage Pieces" and "Reorganize Pages" views, hold down the shift button while clicking a second piece. All pieces between the two pieces selected so far will be chosen.
* Fixed a bug where removing an array item other than the last could cause a failure of the array field editor if the last array item were active. Thanks to anwarhussain93.

## 2.84.1 (2019-03-25)

* Documentation issue only. No code changes.

## 2.84.0 (2019-03-25)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* `npm audit` issue: `nunjucks`
  * Created maintenance-only fork of `nunjucks` 2.x as `@apostrophecms/nunjucks`
  * We will use Nunjucks 3.x in Apostrophe 3.x, this is a maintenance fork only
  * Addressed dependency on old version of `chokidar` in `nunjucks` 2.x

* `npm audit` issue: `clean-css`
  * Verified this module offers no significant improvement in minification over the `compress` flag of `less`
  * Removed this module from ApostropheCMS
  * Verified CSS still minifies

* You may now sort the "Manage Pieces" view by clicking on any column that has a `sort`
property. By default `title` and `updatedAt` are now sortable. When using `addColumns`
specify a `sort` property like:

```javascript
sort: {
  title: 1
}
```

For more information see [custom columns and sortable columns for the "manage pieces"
modal](https://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/reusable-content-with-pieces.html#custom-columns-and-sortable-columns-for-the-quot-manage-quot-modal).

* Fixed several situations formerly requiring a page refresh before editing. More
such fixes to come. Thanks to `hexitex` for the bug reports and insight into the
causes.

* A recent change broke the display of the minimum image size to the user. This
has been fixed.

* A new warning has been added for failure to use `arrangeFields` comprehensively for
all of your fields to make the "manage pieces" modal as clear as possible for the user.

* Fixes were made allowing contextual editing of more types of content nested in `object` fields on the page. Thanks to bharathkumarc.

Many thanks to Michelin for making much of this work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.83.1 (2019-03-13)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Bug fix: a crash in the lock refresh route was possible if an advisory lock was taken away by another tab or user. Thanks to `hexitex` for the report and the solution.

## 2.83.0 (2019-03-12)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* When using the `apostrophe-pieces-import` module, you may now set the `importAsRichText: true` option on an `area` or `singleton` field to import markup rather than treating it as plaintext. With this setting in place the behavior matches `apostrophe-pieces-export`. Also note that both `apostrophe-pieces-import` and `apostrophe-pieces-export` have been updated to be more compatible with one another.

## 2.82.0 (2019-03-08)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* If the `APOS_ALWAYS_COPY_ASSETS` environment variable is set, always copy assets rather than symlinking them. This is useful when running under Docker. Thanks to hexitex for this contribution. See also [building Docker images for Apostrophe projects](https://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/docker.html).

## 2.81.2 (2019-03-06)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Stability improvement: search index method of the `tags` type will not crash if the `tags` type is somehow truthy without being an array.

## 2.81.1 (2019-03-05)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Default values are now respected by the global doc. Specifically, if your field has a `def` property when the global doc is first created, it will be set accordingly. In addition, if a field is added to the schema and your site is restarted, it will also be added with the correct default at this time. Tests coverage has been added for this scenario.

## 2.81.0 (2019-03-04)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The conflict resolution mechanism for simultaneous edits has been improved. Previously, Apostrophe tracked how long it had been since the "last edit" by the previous person. But if the browser window closed without sending an "unlock" message, that "last edit" might be a very long time ago. This led to nuisance confirmation prompts and a tendency to ignore their message.

Beginning with this release, the browser instead actively refreshes the lock periodically. And if the browser does not do so for 5 minutes, the lock is automatically discarded.

This greatly reduces the chance that you will see a "someone else is editing that document" message when this is not actually the case.

However, do note that you will no longer see an indication of the "last edit" time. This is because this time was never really meaningful for the "Edit Piece" dialog box, and often misleading for on-page editing as well. Instead, you may assume that the other person is still at the very least on the page in question if you see this message at all.

* Although it was released separately as part of the `launder` module, and an `npm update` should fetch it for you automatically, it should be mentioned that `launder` version 1.1.1 has been released and prevents crashes if the `value` of some of your select element choices is null or undefined. Such choices do not work and cannot be selected reliably (only strings and numbers are supported, including the empty string), but since versions prior to 1.1.0 did not crash on such choices, we have patched 1.1.1 to also tolerate their presence.

Thanks to our [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support) clients for making these enhancements possible.

* The case-insensitive sort for filter choices no longer crashes if a choice cannot be converted to a string. Thanks to Fawzi Fakhro.

## 2.80.0 (2019-02-28)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* A recently introduced change broke the filtering that prevented users from selecting too-small images when `minSize` is in effect. This has been corrected. Note that site visitors never actually saw too-small images because filtering did take effect later in the process.
* Numbers (in addition to strings) are now permissible choices for select elements. If the choice selected is a number, a number will be stored in the field. Most of this fix is in the `launder` module but there is a small fix in apostrophe core as well.
* If a doc is in the trash already, the edit dialog box should have a "Rescue" button rather than a "Trash" button on the "More" dropdown menu.
* `boolean` fields can now be made `mandatory`. If a boolean field is mandatory, the form will not validate unless the user selects "Yes." This is useful for simple "terms and conditions" forms. You must specify a message to be shown to the user if they do not select "Yes," like this:

```
{
  name: 'toc',
  label: 'Accept the Terms and Conditions',
  type: 'boolean',
  // Displayed if you try to save without picking Yes
  mandatory: 'You must accept the Terms and Conditions to continue.',
  // Always displayed
  help: 'I have read and accept the Terms and Conditions.'
}
```

Although the documentation formerly claimed that `required: true` would have this effect for boolean fields, it was pointed out that this functionality did not work, and as a result far too many sites already use `required: true` for booleans in a way that would break if we implemented the original documented behavior. Therefore we are changing the documentation to match this new implementation that maintains backwards compatibility.

## 2.79.0 (2019-02-22)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Built-in migration progress meter is much improved. The new implementation:
  * Does not display anything if the task completes within 1 second;
  * Allows work to begin even before the total number of items is known;
  * Has a much more stable ETA;
  * Does not crop the total off the far end;
  * Displays steps/sec (very useful metric for development); and
  * Has highly stable formatting (not distracting to the eye).
* Eliminates unnecessary warnings about unconsumed promises in migrations.

## 2.78.0 (2019-02-15)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* You can now set permissions for many pieces at once via the new "set permissions for..."
batch operation in the "manage pieces" dialog box. Batch operations are accessible via a
dropdown at the bottom of the dialog box after you check the boxes to select various pieces.
Note that if you check the box to select all the pieces on this page, you will be asked
if you want to select *all* pieces. So it is possible to set the permissions of all of the
pieces at once.

Note that **permissions have no effect on file attachment URLs unless you use
the optional [apostrophe-secure-attachments](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-secure-attachments) module.** Once you add that module, the new batch operation becomes a powerful
way to lock down all of your PDFs at once.

* The "Select Everything" checkbox for pieces, which becomes accessible after you "Select All"
pieces on the current page, now operates much faster on large databases and does not block
the main thread of browser execution for an extended time.

Thanks to our [enterprise clients](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support),
including Michelin, for their support of our work on these items.

## 2.77.2 (2019-02-12)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing (including new migrations test).

* Most migrations were failing when run in a non-interactive session.
This was due to a stray piece of code that tried to interact with the
progress meter when it was not available. This has been fixed. This
was the underlying major issue in version 2.77.0.
* The recent migration to set the `docIds` and `trashDocIds` properties of
attachments correctly, allowing them to become inaccessible at the
proper time, now runs and completes correctly, at the end of which
all attachment permissions are properly restored. This resolves the issue
that began with version 2.77.0.
* The migration was also updated to avoid any chance of needlessly
disabling permissions on a temporary basis during the migration run.
* **If you temporarily lost access to your media due to running migrations
with 2.77.0, which was available for a few hours today, you can restore access**
with the following command line task:

```
node app apostrophe-attachments:recompute-all-doc-references
```

**If you manually set your permissions globally as a workaround**, you should run
this task to reset them appropriately:

```
node app apostrophe-attachments:reset-uploadfs-permissions
```

Although there is no reason to expect a recurrence of this issue, these
command line tasks will continue to be available going forward, just in case.

### Regression test updates

Our regression tests are being updated to prevent a recurrence by
noninteractively invoking `apostrophe-migrations:migrate`
and checking for a clean exit code.

## 2.77.1 (2019-02-12)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Unfortunately the new migration in 2.77.0 appears to have caused
all permissions to revert to 000 on uploaded media on at least one site.
In an abundance of caution we have pushed out 2.77.1 which does not
carry out that migration. We are working on 2.77.2 which will carry it out
properly. You may restore your permissions with
`chmod 644 public/uploads/attachments/*`, if you are using S3 you
can do this by restoring public access to each file, for Azure the
suffix added to the name to disable each file would need to be removed.
Fortunately this issue was caught quickly so there are probably no
instances of the latter two in the wild.

We apologize for this serious issue and will provide a complete postmortem
with 2.77.2.

## 2.77.0 (2019-02-12)

* **The home page now works correctly when it is a pieces-page** powered by
`apostrophe-pieces-pages`. Specifically, the URLs of pieces are generated
correctly in this situation. This allows the home page to be a blog page,
for example. Regression tests have been added to ensure this does
not break in the future.

* **Attachments (files) now become inaccessible properly** when the
last file or image piece that directly contains them moves to the trash.
Formerly, attachments were incorrectly marked as "part of" pages that
merely loaded them as part of a join or similar relationship. **A migration
has been added** to correctly reset the `docIds` and `trashDocIds` arrays
of all attachments on a one-time basis after which they will be tracked
properly going forward.

* **Migrations now have a progress display when iterating over all
documents.** This progress display automatically goes away if the
migrations task is not running with access to a TTY (for instance,
it is running in a deployment pipeline). You may note that not all
migrations use this feature; generally the most time-consuming will however.

* **You can now specify a projection for a reverse join without the need to explicitly include the `idsField`, or even know what it is.** This was one of several reasons why developers often gave up on projections for reverse joins, or went back to the old approach of specifying `idsField` rather than using `reverseOf`.

Here is an example from the [apostrophe-samples](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-samples) project:

```javascript
// Forward join: in schema of products
{
  name: '_specialists',
  type: 'joinByArray',
  withType: 'specialist',
  label: 'Specialists',
  help: 'The right people to ask about this product.'
}
```

```javascript
// Reverse join: in schema of specialists
{
  name: '_products',
  type: 'joinByArrayReverse',
  withType: 'product',
  reverseOf: '_specialists',
  projection: {
    _url: 1,
    title: 1
  }
}
```

> Note that we can also project `_url: 1` to get all the fields necessary
to populate `_url` when the product is fetched, even though it is not
a real property in the database.

* Unnecessary schema validation errors are no longer thrown when using
`joinByOneReverse` with `reverseOf`.

* Schema fields named `format` are now allowed for pieces. There was a
conflict with the UI code and backend routes of the "Manage Pieces" dialog box.

* "Drag and drop" now works properly for widgets that have just been
added to the page. There is no need to refresh the page first.

## 2.76.1 (2019-02-06)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Removed unneeded call to `self.apos.utils.readOnlySession` in `apos.notify`, preventing crashes when this is invoked from a command line task. This fixes `apostrophe-favicons`.
* Also updated `self.apos.utils.readOnlySession` so it will gracefully ignore calls made with no session in `req` (typically command line tasks).
* Eliminated uses of `async/await` in core unit tests. This module still supports Node 6.x, so we use promises directly, not via async/await, in core code; of course you can still `await` most of our APIs in your own projects, because `await` works with anything that returns a promise.
* Fixed a bug that prevented page permissions from propagating properly when "Apply to Subpages" is checked in "Page Settings." Thanks to Mayank Bansal. Unit tests were also added to prevent a regression in the future.
* A bug that prevented the home page type from being changed via the UI in certain situations has been fixed.

## 2.76.0 (2019-02-01)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Email schema field type added. Thanks to Andrea Di Mario.
* Developer warnings for bad `showFields` configuration now apply to all field types that support `showFields`.
* Schemas are now validated for nested `array` and `object` schemas, giving developers more information to help them fix their code.
* The `poll-notifications` API now runs as middleware that is scheduled as early as `req.user` becomes available, avoiding the overhead of loading `req.data.global` in this frequently polled API.
* The `poll-notifications` API does not crash if the `apos` object has been destroyed. This is not an issue for typical sites. However, this fix removes scary error messages displayed by the very useful [apostrophe-monitor](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-monitor) module, which is similar to `nodemon` but specialized to Apostrophe for much faster restarts.
* Although technically released in the `moog-require` module, not here, a recent fix in that module bears mentioning because it prevents both `apostrophe-monitor` and `apostrophe-multisite` from misbehaving when the options objects of modules are modified. Specifically, the modifications are now reliably distinct for each `apos` object.
*
* The logic that removes certain typically unwanted buttons from CKEditor is now conditional and does not remove them when they are explicitly requested in the toolbar. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* Placeholder markup when a pieces widget is empty. Although not often used directly, this template is often copied as a starting point.
* An open "add widget" area menu now appears above any hovered widget controls rather than being lost behind them.
* `showFields` support for fields of type `checkboxes` has been restored.
* The "recursion warning" that appears when the same doc is loaded more than 5 times in a single request can now be suppressed on a per-request basis by setting `req.suppressAreaLoaderRecursionWarnings` to `true`. However the runaway loading process is still prevented. This is mainly of use for workflow API routes that examine many documents but are OK with stopping in this situation without generating extra log messages.

Thanks to Michelin for sponsoring much of this work through [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.75.1 (2019-01-24)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* If a user has the type-specific `admin-product` permission, they should always be able to view a `product`, no matter whether it is published or not. This logic was correct for editing but not for viewing. Fixed a bug that led to crashes with the workflow module in this scenario.

Thanks to Michelin for making this fix possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.75.0 (2019-01-15)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* An "Undo" button has been added for the "Remove Widget" feature. Although such changes can be undone via "Page Versions," that feature is advanced and somewhat hard to find, whereas this simple "Undo" button is immediately helpful to most users.
* Apostrophe now displays warnings for several common developer errors. Previously it was difficult to understand why a module didn't work if `extend` was missing for certain common cases, like a `-widgets` or `-pieces-pages` subclass module. We will expand these warnings over time; options are provided to disable them if they do not apply to your situation.
* The server side notification persistence feature introduced in version 2.74.0 led to an intermittent bug: the "long polling" used to deliver notifications quickly interacted badly with the "resave" behavior of Express sessions, resulting in frequent loss of other session changes, such as draft/live mode switching. This has been fixed. Since we cannot disable `resave` with the standard session store in Apostrophe 2.x, an `apos.utils.readOnlySession(req)` method was added, and the route that "long polls" for new notifications now uses it to disable any modification to the session for the duration of the request.
* `limitByAll`, `limitByTag` and `limitById` options for `apostrophe-pieces-widgets`. When set the user is not prompted to choose their own maximum.
* Fixed conditions in which editing the first or last name of a new `apostrophe-user` did not affect their `slug` in the expected way.
* Fixed bug: if trashInSchema is in effect, subpages should not have their trash status overridden to match the new parent when their ancestor is moved. This is important when using "Reorganize" with workflow. Additional improvements to better integrate "Reorganize" into the workflow module are separately forthcoming.
* Fixed a bug that prevented `view` permissions from being given out programmatically in certain edge cases.
* The `slug` cursor filter now has a `launder` method, for use when marking it safe for `req.query`. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.

Thanks to our customers at Michelin and NPM for making much of the above work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.74.0 (2018-12-13)

Unit tests passing.

Manual regression tests passing.

* Server-side code may now call `apos.notify(req, 'This is a message')` to send a message to the logged-in user associated with `req`. That message will pop up on the browser and will remain visible until they dismiss it. If the user is not logged in right now, they will see it when they do log in.

You may use `%s` to interpolate additional string arguments, and you may pass an `options` object with `dismiss: true` for a self-dismissing notification. You may also set the `type` option to `error`, `warn` or `success` for different visual treatments. For example:

```
apos.notify(req, 'Sorry, you did not win a shiny new %s!', req.piece.title, { type: 'error' });
```

The API is identical to that for `apos.notify` on the browser side, except that `req` must be passed as the first argument. Also the method returns a promise, which resolves when the notification has reached the database. You may also optionally pass a final callback for the same purpose. This is useful when sending a notification just before a task exits the process. The rest of the time you won't need to worry about it.

* In `2.73.0`, an optional second argument, `locale`, was added to the `date` Nunjucks filter. As it turns out this was done in a way that could have a knock-on effect on later uses of `date` that did not specify a locale. This has been fixed and unit tests have been added. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.

* The values of fields hidden via `showFields` are now saved to the database, as long as they contain no errors. This allows you to return to an old setting and discover all of its sub-settings intact.

* By default, Apostrophe deletes old asset bundles from uploadfs (S3, azure, etc.) five minutes after the launch of the site. The assumption is that the deployment of static assets has reached all peer servers and there is no need to keep old assets around. The `uploadfsBundleCleanup` option to `apostrophe-assets` may now be set explicitly to `false` to prevent this, as may be needed if asset bundles are shared between sub-deployments that are made at greatly varying times.

* When `apostrophe-workflow` is present, "Batch Commit" and other inappropriate options are no longer offered for groups, which are not subject to workflow.

Thanks to Michelin for making much of the above work possible via [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).

## 2.73.0 (2018-12-06)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Added in-context editing support, support for the `contextual` flag, and `skipInitialModal` support for areas and singletons nested in fields of type `object`. Many thanks to Michelin for making this feature possible through their participation in [Apostrophe Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.org/support/enterprise-support).
* The `date` Nunjucks filter now accepts `locale` as a second argument. If `locale` is not present and `req.locale` is set, that locale is used, rather than the default system locale. Thanks to Tim Otlik.
* Removed nuisance warnings about tolerant sanitization.
* When using the `passwordReset: true` feature of `apostrophe-login`, you may also set the `passwordResetSubject` option to a custom subject line for the password reset email message.
* The mechanism that sends the password reset request confirmation email has been factored out to the `apos.login.sendPasswordResetEmail(req, user)` method, so you can trigger it for your own reasons. This method returns a promise; when that promise resolves the password reset email has been successfully handed off for delivery. Note that the promise will be rejected if the user object has no `email` property.

## 2.72.3 (2018-12-03)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The "apply to subpages" feature for page permissions has been greatly simplified and made easier to understand. There is now just one shared "copy these permissions to subpages now?" dropdown, which applies to ALL current permissions for the current page: "who can view this page," "these users can view," "these groups can edit," etc.

As the help text now properly explains, if you pick "yes" and save page settings as usual, the permissions of all subpages are updated to match **on a one-time basis.** After that, you can edit them normally for the subpages. This is an action that takes place at "save" time, it is not a setting that is remembered.

This is good for laying down a baseline and then making fine-tuned adjustments per page, which is typical practice.

Previously this choice appeared in several places, including as a highly confusing and visually cluttered dropdown within the list of permissions per user and group. While theoretically this allowed for propagating fine-tuned adjustments to subpages one at a time, in practice users did not understand it, including many enterprise customers who invest significant time in Apostrophe. Therefore a simpler solution is of greater overall value.

* Regression fix: support for in-context, on-page editing of areas in array fields has been restored.

* Attempts to save a field of type `object` with a missing `required` field now behave sensibly, you no longer see a spinner forever on a grayed-out page. Note that the use of `required` for the object itself has no meaning because there is always an object; you should make its fields required, or not, as you see fit.

* "Move" and "Trash" operations on widgets now emit the Apostrophe events `widgetMoved` and `widgetTrashed`. The widget's container div is emitted as the argument to the event.

## 2.72.2 (2018-11-28)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The `apostrophe-jobs` `runNonBatch` method no longer crashes if the job-runner function provided does not return an object (for instance, because it takes a callback so its return value does not matter).
* `apostrophe-attachments:list` task lists the URLs of all valid attachments, including all crops in all sizes.
* `array` fields may be used in the `relationship` of a join. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.
* Added missing callback to asset bundle cleanup for cloud deployments, ensuring that the lock is eventually released and the old bundles are eventually removed.
* Fixed documentation for `apos.jobs` methods re: the `labels` option.

## 2.72.1 (2018-11-07)

* Moving a page beneath a parent that happens to be considered "not trash" should not automatically cause the child to be considered "not trash" when workflow is in effect, or when the `trashInSchema` flag has been opted into for `apostrophe-docs`. In these cases the trash flag is just another schema property. This bug led to pages inadvertently becoming live across all locales when moved in the page tree.
* The server-side video schema field converter no longer crashes the process if given a `null` property, and correctly flags the field as in error if it is `required` and not present.
* Any missing values for join relationships relating to permissions are now handled in a proper migration in apostrophe core, rather than a hack in apostrophe-workflow that adds significant startup time in certain situations.
* Migration completion is now logged.
* UX fix: UI/area controls no longer compete with "Add Content."

Thanks to our enterprise support customers for their support of this work.

## 2.72.0 (2018-10-30)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Support for subdirectories of `lib/modules`. You must set the `nestedModuleSubdirs` option to `true` in `app.js`. You can then place your modules in nested subdirectories of `lib/modules`. **The names of the parent folders do not matter,** and **the name of the actual module folder must still match the name of the module.**

In addition, when using this feature you may optionally move part of your `modules` configuration into a `modules.js` file in each directory. Here is an example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  'module-name': {},
  'other-module-name': {}
};
```

By following through with this approach you can make `app.js` much shorter. Configuration of Apostrophe modules installed via `npm` must still be done in `app.js`.

* The `apostrophe-html-widgets` module now properly concatenates fields to the standard HTML field when `addFields` is used with it.

* Fixed a crashing bug when an API was used in an atypical way. Thanks to Max Schlueter.

## 2.71.1 (2018-10-24)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

Recent changes to the markup for buttons broke drag and drop for widgets. This has been fixed.

## 2.71.0 (2018-10-23)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* When two pieces or pages would have the same slug as the result of an insert or update, Apostrophe automatically appends a unique string. This makes sense for data integrity but as a user experience it leaves something to be desired.

Beginning with this release, if you are editing the title in the piece or page settings editor and apostrophe is making automatic slug suggestions, these suggestions will *now include the suffix* needed to avoid a conflict. This gives you a chance to see what will happen, and decide to change the title or the slug in a better way. However, you can disable this by setting the `deconflictSlugs` option of the `apostrophe-docs` module explicitly to `false`. If you do, then from now on you will *receive a straightforward error message if the suggested slug is in conflict with another slug on the site.*

* If you edit the slug directly and try to save it with a conflict, Apostrophe will always report a straightforward error in the editor, requiring you to fix it manually. This makes sense when you are editing the slug yourself, because it means you care about the exact value.

For backwards compatibility and to resolve race conditions, the server will still automatically modify the slug to be unique in the rare event that a conflict arises during the save operation itself.

* A simpler yet even better slug prevention feature, in many ways: all `apostrophe-pieces` modules now accept a `slugPrefix` option. For instance, if you set this option to `people-` for your `people` module and to `image-` for the `apostrophe-images` module, the slugs for your people and the photos of them you are uploading will never be in conflict.

We appreciate our enterprise customers and their support of this work.

## 2.70.1 (2018-10-18)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Bug fix: when you attempt to edit a piece that someone else has open in the edit dialog box, you should receive a warning, and the option to take over or leave it alone. This worked, however the "advisory lock" was not released when *closing* the dialog box. So users saw superfluous warnings. The bug was related to calling `$.jsonCall` with the wrong order of arguments.
* Bug fix: a user without permissions to lock a particular document could cause a process restart by attempting to lock it. No inappropriate access was granted.
* When configuring the `csrf` option of `apostrophe-express`, you may now pass the `cookie` subproperty in order to pass configuration options to `res.cookie`, such as `secure: true`.
* The jQuery `onSafe` plugin now respects the return value of the event handler, allowing the use of `return false;` in such handlers. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* The Apostrophe `button` macro now renders a `button` rather than an anchor tag, except when the `url` option is present. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.

## 2.70.0 (2018-10-08)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

Apostrophe now allows direct import of unparsed CSS files via import flags of LESS. The best use of this option is to push a CSS file created by a SASS compiler or other LESS alternative.

To push a CSS asset *without* compiling it as LESS, you may write:

```
self.pushAsset('stylesheet', {
  name: 'bundle',
  import: {
    inline: true
  }
});
```

Or, if you are pushing assets via the `stylesheets` option of the `apostrophe-assets` module, you may write:

```
'apostrophe-assets': {
  stylesheets: [
    {
      name: 'bundle',
      import: {
        inline: true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The extension of the file may be either `.css` or `.less`; either way it is imported with no LESS compilation. Apostrophe will still modify URLs to accommodate the global `prefix` option, if present.

## 2.69.1 (2018-10-04)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* In-context editing of areas nested in arrays now works correctly when the widget containing the array has just been added to the page for the first time.

## 2.69.0 (2018-10-03)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Promisified all of the apis for migrations, including the option of iterators that return promises, and implemented migrations for old piece and page slugs that have not been deduplicated and thus can block new pages or pieces from taking a slug even though we have logic for this for new pages and pieces.
* In-context editing support for areas and singletons that are schema fields of arrays. Leaves other, noncontextual data alone. Creating and editing entire array items contextually is outside the scope of this change; use an area rather than an array for that. Directly nested arrays are not supported, but you may use an area in an array in a widget in an array, etc.
* `.jpeg` files were slipping through with that extension. All new uploads will be correctly converted to `.jpg` and go through the proper sizing process.
* The `enableShowFields` option was missing some of its logic for fields of type `checkboxes`. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.
* A `_title` property is now included in attachments returned by `apos.images.all` and `apos.images.first`.
* When apostrophe cannot fix a unique key error, it is helpful to be able to see the last error, as well as the original one. This helps you figure it out if both a unique slug error and an unrelated unique key error are part of the puzzle. We still throw the original error, but we also attach the last error as a property of it, so you can see both.
* The `apos.areas.fromPlaintext` method now takes an `options` parameter. You may set the `el` property to an element name, in which case the markup is wrapped in that HTML element. `options` may be omitted.

## 2.68.1 (2018-09-27)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* When we introduced allowedSubpageTypes and allowedHomepageTypes in 2.67.0, we  broke support for different schemas in different page types. Those regressions are fixed here.
* The default page type choice offered for a new page is the first type permitted by its parent page.

## 2.68.0 (2018-09-26)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The `lateCriteria` cursor filter now works properly, allowing special mongodb criteria that are not allowed inside `$and` to be merged into the criteria object at the last minute.
* A noisy warning produced on every page send by the latest version of Bluebird has been silenced.
* Performance: explicitly shut off `sort()` for certain cases where we know only one document will be returned. This allows MongoDB to select a more efficient index more often.
* `nlbr` Nunjucks filter no longer results in double-escaped markup. Thanks to Ulf Seltmann.
* The `apostrophe-global` module now supports the `separateWhileBusyMiddleware` option. Iby separate middleware that checks for the lock flag in apostrophe-global even if the regular middleware of this method has been disabled and/or overridden to cache in such a way as to make it unsuitable for this purpose. For normal use this option is not necessary.
* Fixes made to further reduce conflicts between sites with `apostrophe-multisite`. For instance, the `apostrophe-workflow` module no longer breaks the dashboard.
* The home page can now be copied. If you copy the home page, you get a new child of the home page with the same content. Thanks to Tim Otlik.

## 2.67.0 (2018-09-14)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Pages can now be locked down with the `allowedHomepageTypes` and `allowedSubpageTypes` options, like this:

```javascript
// Only one type allowed for the home page
allowedHomepageTypes: [ 'home' ],

allowedSubpageTypes: {
  // Two subpage types allowed for the home page
  'home': [ 'default', 'apostrophe-blog-page' ],
  // No subpages for the blog page ("show pages" don't count)
  'apostrophe-blog-page': [],
  // default page type can only have another default page as a subpage
  'default': [ 'default' ]
}
```

These options make it easy to prevent users from creating unintended scenarios, like nesting pages too deeply for your navigation design.

* Pages now support batch operations, just like pieces do. The initial set includes trash, rescue, publish, unpublish, tag and untag. You can only rescue pages in this way if you are using the `trashInSchema` option of the docs module, which is always the case with `apostrophe-workflow`. With the conventional trash can, it is unclear what should happen because you have not indicated where you want each page to be restored. New batch operations for pages can be added in the same way that they are added for pieces.

* Important performance fix needed for those using the `apostrophe-pieces-orderings-bundle` module to create custom sort orders for pieces. Without this fix it is also possible to get a loader error and stop fetching content prematurely.

* The "revert" button for versions is now labeled "Revert to" to emphasize that it reverts to what you had at the end of that operation, not its beginning. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.

## 2.66.0 (2018-09-07)

* Updated to CKEditor version 4.10.0. The CKEditor build now includes the CKEditor "widgets" feature (not to be confused with Apostrophe widgets). These are essential for modules like the forthcoming `apostrophe-rich-text-merge-tags`.
* `apos.areas.richText` and `apos.areas.plaintext` no longer produce duplicate text. To achieve this, the `apos.docs.walk` method no longer walks through the `_originalWidgets` property. This property is only used to preserve the previous versions of widgets that the user lacks permission to edit due to schema field permissions. Exploration of this property by `apos.docs.walk` led to the observed bug.
* The browser-side implementation of `apos.utils.escapeHtml` now works properly.

## 2.65.0 (2018-09-04)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* **Important fix for MongoDB replica sets:** previously we used the `autoReconnect` option of the MongoDB driver by default. From now on, we use it only if the MongoDB URI does not refer to a replica set. The use of `autoReconnect` is [inappropriate with a replica set](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1508) because it will keep trying to connect to the node that went down. Leaving this option out results in automatic use of nodes that are up. Also see the [apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver) module for a way to use the newer `mongodb+srv` URIs. Thanks to Matt Broadstone of MongoDB for his advice.

* An `apostrophe-file` now has a default URL. The default `_url` property of an `apostrophe-file` piece is simply the URL of the file itself. This allows `apostrophe-file` to be included in your configuration for [apostrophe-permalinks](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-permalinks); picking a PDF in this way generates a direct link to the PDF, which is what the user expects. Note that if the developer elects to set up an `apostrophe-files-pages` module that extends `apostrophe-pieces-pages`, that will still take precedence, so there is no bc break.

* Clicking directly from one rich text widget into another did not work properly; the toolbar did not appear in this situation. This bug has been fixed. The bug only occurred when clicking in a second rich text widget without any intervening clicks outside of all rich text widgets.

* Also see expanded notes on version `2.64.1`, below, which contained several features missed in the original changelog.

## 2.64.1 (2018-08-31)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Improved Apostrophe's ability to redisplay the appropriate widget, array element, and field and call the user's attention to it when a schema field error is not detected until server-side validation takes place. This addresses problems that come up when fields become `required` at a later time, and/or data was originally created with an earlier release of Apostrophe that did not enforce `required` in all situations. Browser-side validation is still preferred for ease of use but server-side validation no longer creates situations the user cannot easily resolve.

* Introduced the `apos.global.whileBusy` method. This method accepts a function to be run *while no one is permitted to access the site.* The provided function may return a promise, and that promise resolves before the site becomes accessible again. In the presence of `apostrophe-workflow` it is possible to mark only one locale as busy.

* By default, the `apos.locks.lock` method waits until the lock is available before proceeding. However there is now a `wait` option which can be set to `false` to avoid waiting at all, or to any number of milliseconds. If the method fails because of `wait`, the error is the string `locked`.

* The `apos.locks.lock` method also now accepts a `waitForSelf` option. By default, if the same process invokes `apos.locks.lock` for the same lock in two requests simultaneously, one of the two will receive an error. With `waitForSelf`, the second invocation will wait for the first to resolve and then obtain the lock.

## 2.64.0 (2018-08-29)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Apostrophe's "search suggestions" feature for `notFound.html` templates is now fully baked. It only takes two steps:

1. Include an element like this in your `notFound.html` template:

```
<div data-apos-notfound-search-results></div>
```

2. Set the `suggestions` option to `true` for the `apostrophe-search` module.

With `suggestions: true`, this feature no longer requires that you have a `/search` page, it uses a dedicated route. See the documentation of the `apostrophe-search` module for more information.

* The `showFields` option is now available for checkboxes. The syntax is as follows:

```
{
  "name": "awesomeBoolean",
  "label": "Awesome Boolean",
  "type": "boolean",
  "choices": [
    {
      "value": true,
      "showFields": ["otherField1"]
    },
    {
      "value": false,
      "showFields": ["otherField2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Thanks to falkodev.

* A useful error message appears if you try to use a `mongodb+srv` URL. These are meant for newer versions of the MongoDB driver. You **can** use them, but you must install the [apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver](https://npmjs.com/package/apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver) module first. The error message now explains this, addressing a common question on stackoverflow.
* Basic styles added for the most common rich text markup tags when within the bounds of an Apostrophe modal. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fixed UI overlap issue when joining with `apostrophe-page`.
* `apos.images.all`, `apos.images.first`, etc. now include `_description`, `_credit` and `_creditUrl` when they can be inferred from an `apostrophe-image` containing the attachment.
* `apos.images.srcset` helper improved. It is now smart enough to limit the image sizes it offers based on what it knows about the size of the original. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* Fixes to CSS asset URL generation to pass validation.
* Performance: eliminated use of `$or` MongoDB queries with regard to pages in the trash. MongoDB tests demonstrate that `$ne: true` is faster than `$or` for our purposes.

## 2.63.0 (2018-08-15)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* “Promise events” have arrived. This is a major feature. Promise events will completely
replace `callAll` in Apostrophe 3.x. For 2.x, all existing invocations of `callAll` in the
core Apostrophe module now also emit a promise event. For instance, when the `docBeforeInsert`
callAll method is invoked, Apostrophe also emits the `beforeInsert` promise event on the
apostrophe-docs` module.

Other modules may listen for this event by writing code like this:

```javascript
`self.on('apostrophe-docs:beforeInsert', 'chooseASpecialist', function(req, doc, options) {
  // Modify `doc` here. You may return a promise, and it will resolve before
  // any more handlers run. Then the doc is inserted
});
```

The above code adds a new `chooseASpecialist` method to your module. This way, the method can be overridden by assigning a new function to `self.chooseASpecialist` in a module that
extends it, or its behavior can be extended in the usual way following the `super` pattern.

But, since it does not have the same name as
the event (attempting to register a method of the same name will throw an error), it is unlikely
that parent class modules and subclass modules will have unintentional conflicts.

See the [original github issue](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/issues/1415) for a more
complete description of the feature and the reasoning behind it.

**Your existing callAll methods will still work.** But, we recommend you start migrating to be
ready to move to 3.x in the future... and because returning promises is just a heck of
a lot nicer. You will have fewer problems.

* Optional SVG support for `apostrophe-attachments`. To enable it, set the `svgImages` option to
`true` when configuring the `apostrophe-attachments` module. SVG files can be uploaded just like
other image types. Manual cropping is not available. However, since most SVG files play very well
with backgrounds, the SVG file is displayed in its entirety without distortion at the largest size
that fits within the aspect ratio of the widget in question, if any (`background-size: contain`
is used). If you have overridden `widget.html` for `apostrophe-images-widgets`, you will want
to refer to the latest version of `widgetBase.html` for the technique we used here to ensure
SVG files do not break the slideshow’s overall height.
* New `apos.templates.prepend` and `apos.templates.append` methods. Call
`apos.templates.prepend('head', function(req) { ... })` to register a function to be called just after
the head tag is opened each time a page is rendered. The output of your function is inserted into
the markup. The standard named locations are `head`, `body`, `contextMenu` and `main`. This is
convenient when writing modules that add new features to Apostrophe. For project level work also see the
named Nunjucks blocks already provided in `outerLayoutBase.html`.
* `apos.singleton` now accepts an `areaOptions` option, which can receive any option that can be
passed to `apos.area`. Thanks to Manoj Krishnan.
* Apostrophe’s “projector” jQuery plugin now respects the `outerHeight` of the tallest slideshow item,
not just the inner height.
* `apos.area` now accepts an `addLabel` option for each widget type in the area. Thanks to
Fredrik Ekelund.
* UI improvements to versioning. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Button to revert to the current version has been replaced with a label indicating it is current,
since reverting to the current version has no effect.
* “Page settings” can now be accessed for any page in the trash via “reorganize.” When
working with `apostrophe-workflow`, this is
often required to commit the fact that a page is in the trash.
* The `uploadfs` module now has a `prefix` option. If present, the prefix is prepended to all uploadfs paths before they reach the storage layer, and is also prepended to URLs. In practice, this means that a single S3 bucket can be used to host multiple sites without all of the uploaded media jumbling together in `/attachments`. The `apostrophe-multisite` module now leverages this.

## 2.62.0 (2018-08-09)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Introduced a `findWithProjection()` method that is added to all MongoDB collection objects. All Apostrophe core modules are migrating towards using this method rather than `find()` when working **directly with MongoDB collections**. If you are using the standard MongoDB 2.x driver that is included with Apostrophe, this just calls regular `find()`. When using the forthcoming `apostrophe-db-mongo-3-driver` module to replace that with a newer driver that supports the full features of MongoDB 3.6, 4.0 and beyond, this method will provide backwards compatibility by accepting a projection as the second argument like `find()` did until the 3.x driver was released. Developers wishing to be compatible with both drivers will want to start using this method. Again, this **only concerns you if you are querying MongoDB directly and passing a projection to find() as the second argument**. And if you don't care about using the 3.x driver, you **do not have to change anything**.
* Various UX improvements and bug fixes to the page versions dialog box. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The widget wrapper is updated on the fly with new classes if they change due to edits. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* When configuring a `date` field, you may pass a `pikadayOptions` property. This object is passed on to the `pikaday` library. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The `counts: true` option for `piecesFilters` now works properly with joins.

## 2.61.0 (2018-08-01)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* New "secrets" feature in `apostrophe-users` makes it easy to hash other "secrets" similar in spirit to passwords.
* This feature is now used for password reset tokens, making them more secure.
* Additional joins can now be added to the schema of a widget that extends `apostrophe-pieces-widgets`.
* Brute force password attacks against an Apostrophe server are now more difficult. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Tolerant sanitization of array items while they are still in the editor. This avoids confusion caused by `required` fields in the array editor.
* Error messages now behave sensibly when multiple label elements appear in a field. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fix background color on notification on uploads when file extension is not accepted. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* If you can't move a widget out of an area, you can no longer move widgets into that area either (movable: false is fully enforced). Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* New browser-side events are emitted during the attachment upload process, and the built-in facility that delays the saving of a form until attachment uploads are complete has been fixed. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fixes to the active state display of array items. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) expanded with lots of new information about practical ways to contribute to Apostrophe.
* [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) added to the project. The Apostrophe community is a welcoming place, and now is a great time to lock that in for the future.

## 2.60.4 (2018-07-13)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Shallowly clone the required definition in defineRelatedType to prevent yet more crosstalk between instances of apos when `apostrophe-multisite` is used. No other changes.

## 2.60.3 (2018-07-13)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Improved support for nested areas and widgets. Apostrophe now pushes the correct doc id and dot path all the way to the page in various situations where this could previously have led to errors at save time.
* The new `apos.locks.withLock(lockName, fn)` method can be used to execute a function while the process has the named lock. This ensures that other processes cannot run that function simultaneously. You may optionally pass a callback, otherwise a promise is returned. Similarly `fn` may take a callback, or no arguments at all, in which case it is expected to return a promise.
* Cleanup: don't call `server.close` unless we've succeeded in listening for connections.

## 2.60.2 (2018-07-12)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Version 2.60.1 broke validation of schema fields which were
`required`, but blank because they were hidden by `showFields`.
This is of course permitted, `required` applies only if the field
is active according to `showFields` or not addressed by any
`showFields` possibilities at all. Comprehensive unit testing was
added for this issue to prevent a recurrence.
* Version 2.60.1 also introduced a more subtle issue: if constraints
like `required` or `min`, or general improvements to validation such
as NaN detection for integers and floats, were added to a widget schema later
after content already existed then it became impossible to open a widget
editor and correct the issues. Validation tolerance was added for this
situation.
* When a user edits an area "in context" on the page, the server now
reports errors using a path that can be used to identify the widget
responsible and open its editing dialog box. A more relevant notification
is also displayed. This remains a secondary mechanism. Server-side
validation is mostly about preventing intentional abuse. Browser-side
validation is still the best way to provide feedback during data entry.

## 2.60.1 (2018-07-11)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Fields of type `checkboxes` now play nicely with the `live/draft` toggle of `apostrophe-workflow`.
* Improved validation of integers and floats. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The "Global" dialog box now follows the same pattern as that for other piece types, which means that the workflow dropdown menu is available if workflow is present.
* Options may be passed to the `express.static` middleware that serves the `public` folder, via the `static` option of the `apostrophe-express` module. Thanks to Leonhard Melzer.
* `apostrophe` now depends on `bluebird` properly and there are no lingering references to the wrong version fo `lodash`. Formerly we got away with this because some of our dependencies did depend on these, and npm flattens dependencies. Thanks to Leonhard Melzer.
* The new `eslint-config-punkave` ruleset is in place, and includes a check for "unofficial dependencies" in `require` calls that could go away suddenly.
* `fieldClasses` and `fieldAttributes` may be set on form fields themselves, similar to the existing `classes` and `attributes` properties that are applied to the `fieldset`. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* The "Pages" admin UI now includes a "New Page" button, in addition to the usual "reorganize" functionality. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Fixed a crash when an `apostrophe-pieces-widget` is configured to always show all pieces via `by: 'all'`. Thanks to Aurélien Wolz.
* General UI styling improvements and fixes.

## 2.60.0 (2018-07-06)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* New feature: you can now display counts for each tag, joined item, etc. when using the `piecesFilters` option of `apostrophe-pieces-pages`. Just add `counts: true` to the configuration for that filter. The count is then available in a `.count` property for each value in the array. See [creating filter UI with apostrophe-pieces-pages](https://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/intermediate/cursors.html#creating-filter-u-i-with-code-apostrophe-pieces-pages-code) for more information.
* New feature: command line tasks such as `apostrophe-blog:generate` may now be run programmatically, for example: `apos.tasks.invoke('apostrophe-blog:generate', { total: 50 })`. A promise is returned if a callback is not passed. Note that not all tasks are written to behave politely and invoke their callback normally, however most do. This feature is most useful when writing tasks that logically should incorporate other tasks.
* Many UX and UI improvements that make the experience more pleasant in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Thanks to Carsten, Marco Arnone and the prolific Lars Houmark for their contributions. This was an excellent week for Apostrophe PRs.
* The full set of controls for joined items are again available in the chooser, as well as in the browse modal.
* The automatic opening of the admin bar menu on page load can now be configured with the `openOnLoad`, `openOnHomepageLoad`, and `closeDelay` options.
* `autocomplete="off"` for date fields prevents chrome autocomplete suggestions from wrecking calendar UI.
* Always remove .apos-global-busy on unlock, even if the transition event never fires. Yes, that is sadly a thing. Prevents the UI from becoming unusable in rare situations (less rare inside functional tests).
* Use `one` to reduce the overhead of .apos-global-busy's transition event handler. We could do more here to reduce overhead, i.e. unhooking it entirely.
* Much-improved validation of `min`, `max` and `required` for strings, integers and floats on both the server and the browser side. Thanks to Lars Houmark.

## 2.59.1 (2018-07-02)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Widget schemas now support the `def` property for fields. This always worked for pieces and pages.
* Accommodations for functional testing in nightwatch. The currently active Apostrophe modal, and all of its proxies such as its controls that are in a separate div for presentation reasons, now has the attribute `data-apos-modal-current` which is set to the class name of the modal. This powers the new [apostrophe-nightwatch-tools](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-nightwatch-tools) module, which provides reusable commands and steps that can be used to create test projects similar to our [apostrophe-enterprise-testbed](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-enterprise-testbed). Testing with the enterprise testbed project is a standard part of our release process.
* Previously if workflow was in use slugs could not be reused by new pages when the original page was in the trash. This has been addressed; the slug is now deduplicated in the same way that email addresses and usernames of users are when in the trash.
* The infinite scroll feature of `apostrophe-pieces-pages` now works as documented with the styles provided. The code is also more efficient and scroll events are throttled for performance. Thanks to Lars Houmark.
* Various UX fixes, thanks to Lars Houmark and various members of the Apostrophe team.

## 2.59.0 (2018-06-15)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Fixed nested widget editing for existing widgets whose modal dialog boxes have been accessed (#1428).
* A clear warning message with instructions has been added for those who are seeing "unblessed" messages due to widget schemas and in-template `apos.area` calls that do not match (#1429). The easiest way to avoid this is to just mark the area `contextual: true` in your widget schema so it is edited *only* on the page. But if you really want to do both, the widget options must match.
* The mechanism that automatically makes slugs, paths and other keys unique now gives up eventually and reports the original duplicate key error. This makes it easier to debug your code if you are violating your own custom indexes that feature unique keys. It is possible to make the deduplicator aware of your own own properties that need to be made more unique on inserts if you wish, by implementing a `docFixUniqueError` method. *Please note:* this change is not a regression. Code that formerly never completed its task in this situation will simply report an error promptly rather than retrying inserts forever while degrading your database performance.
* A new profiling API has been added: the `apos.utils.profile` method. This method can be called to report how long code takes to run for later analysis. It does nothing in the default implementation; modules like our forthcoming profiler override it to give feedback on the speed of your code.

## 2.58.0 (2018-06-13)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Polymorphic joins have arrived! You may now create joins like this:

```javascript
{
  name: '_items',
  type: 'joinByArray',
  withType: [ 'apostrophe-blog', 'product', 'apostrophe-page' ]
}
```

When you join with more than one type, Apostrophe presents a chooser that allows you to pick between tabs for each type. Note that `apostrophe-page` can be included, so you can pick a mix of pages and pieces for the same join.

This feature is useful for creating navigation that may point to a variety of document types, without the need for an array of items with several different joins and a `select` element to choose between them.

Polymorphic joins work for both `joinByOne` and `joinByArray`. Currently they are **not** available for `joinByOneReverse`, `joinByArrayReverse`, or pieces filters. Their primary use case is creating navigation widgets.

* `apos.images.srcset` helper function added. You can use this function to generate a `srcset` attribute for responsive display of an image. Just pass an attachment to the helper:

`<img srcset="{{ apos.images.srcset(apos.images.first(data.piece.thumbnail)) }}" />`

A `src` attribute for backwards compatibility is always advisable too.

Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund for this contribution.

* Fast forms for big schemas are back! The issue with tags has been resolved.

* A single MongoDB connection may be reused by several `apos` objects for separate sites, a feature which is exploited by the [apostrophe-multisite](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-multisite) module. Note that this only reuses the connection, it does not share a single MongoDB database. It *does* allow you to keep potentially hundreds of sites on a single MongoDB server or replica set, as the overhead of multiple logical "databases" is small in MongoDB's modern WiredTiger storage engine. To reuse a connection, pass it to the `apostrophe-db` module as the `db` option.

* Fixed a MongoDB 3.6 incompatibility in the "Apply to Subpages" feature for permissions. Also made this feature available again when *removing* someone's permissions. We plan further UX work here to make this feature easier to understand and use.

* UX fix to the "manage tags" dialog box: don't attempt to add an empty tag. Thanks to Anthony Tarlao.

* Warn developers if they use bad area names.

* For those deploying asset bundles to S3: the command line task that builds an asset bundle no longer requires access to your production database, although it still needs to start up normally with access to a database in the pre-production environment where you are building the bundle.

* Refactoring of the trash field deduplication features, in preparation to extend them to pages as well in an upcoming release.

## 2.57.2 (2018-06-07)

Unit tests passing.

Relevant regression tests passing.

* New `extraHtml` block in `outerLayoutBase.html` allows your `outerLayout.html` to add attributes to the outer `html` element without the need to completely override the layout. It is a best practice to avoid completely overriding the layout because this maximizes your compatibility with future updates to our admin markup, etc.

## 2.57.1 (2018-06-05)

Unit tests passing.

* Hotfix for bug in 2.57.0 that broke saving tags. We have reverted the "fast forms" change until the cause is understood.

## 2.57.0 (2018-05-31)

Unit tests passing.

Functional tests passing.

* Displaying and saving schema-driven forms is much, much faster.
This becomes very noticeable with 100 or more fields. With about
250 fields, this formerly took about 4.5 seconds to load or to
save such a form on a fast Mac. It now takes about 250 milliseconds.
* Users may re-order the items they have selected via drag and drop
when using "Browse" to select pieces, images, etc.
* Prior to this release, asset generation ids were surprisingly short and
made up only of digits due to an accidental holdover from an old version.
Conflicts were rare, but possible. Asset generation ids are now proper cuids,
no conflicts should occur.
* IDs may be added to notifications as a simple way to give other
code access to them.
* The `apos.global.addGlobalToData` method may now be called
with just `req` (returns a promise), with `req, callback` (invokes
the callback), or as middleware (which Apostrophe does by default).
This method is handy in command line tasks and other places
where middleware does not run and `req.data.global` is not populated
by default.

## 2.56.0 (2018-05-17)

Unit tests passing.

Functional tests passing.

* **Security:** numerous issues formerly flagged by the new `npm audit` command have been addressed. We are now using a [maintained branch of lodash 3.x](https://github.com/sailshq/lodash) to keep bc while addressing security (many thanks to the Sails team). We are also using LESS 3.x, which has caused no issues in our testing and corrects security concerns with LESS 2.x. Numerous `npm audit` security reports regarding `imagemin` modules were addressed by removing `imagemin` from `uploadfs` itself, however you may opt into it via the new [`postprocessors` option of `uploadfs`](https://github.com/punkave/uploadfs). As of this writing, one `npm audit` complaint remains: the `azure-storage` module needs to update a dependency to address a possible vulnerability. You may mitigate this issue by not using the `azure` backend of `uploadfs` with Apostrophe until it is resolved upstream.
* Many UI enhancements when choosing, browsing and managing items which reduce user confusion. For instance: moving items up and down in a selection no longer refreshes the entire list and forces the user to scroll down again. Trashed pages are easier to distinguish in "reorganize." "More" dropdown for pieces is again fully visible when clicked. Placeholder helpers make the search field for joins easier to understand. Chevrons added to various select elements which were difficult to identify as dropdowns before.
* Deeply nested areas now save properly. Formerly in certain situations the same widget might be duplicated.
* `apos.tasks.getReq` now supplies an empty `req.data` object for easier use with code expecting an Express request, Apostrophe-style.
* Bedeviled by case-sensitive sorting? The `sortify: true` property for `string` schema fields is now documented and automatically creates a database migration to ensure it is available for your existing data as well. When used, this flag ensures that any `sort('fieldname')` call for that field in Apostrophe is case-insensitive, ignores punctuation and otherwise behaves as end users expect.

## 2.55.2 (2018-05-15)

Unit tests passing.

Relevant functional tests passing.

* Reverted change to date formatting. `moment` will produce warnings again, but dates will not be a day old in some time zones, which is more important. We are working on a better fix for this problem.

## 2.55.1 (2018-05-15)

Unit tests passing.

Relevant functional tests passing.

* `apos.migrations.eachArea` no longer crashes the stack when iterating over a large number of documents without areas.

## 2.55.0 (2018-05-11)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Security fix: uploaded images "in the trash" were still accessible at the same URL in most sizes. This has been corrected. As documented, the only size that now remains accessible is the `one-sixth` size, and this choice can be changed or eliminated entirely. **This bug did not affect other file attachments, such as PDFs.**

As always, be sure to run the `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` task. This will make sure the permissions of your files are correct. Harmless warnings may appear for those that were already correct.

* The `apostrophe-attachments:migrate-to-disabled-file-key` and `apostrophe-attachments:migrate-from-disabled-file-key` have been added for the convenience of those using the `disabledFileKey` option to `uploadfs` to rename disabled files in a cryptographically sound way rather than changing their permissions. These are relevant only with the `local` storage option of `uploadfs`, since since the option is neither available nor necessary for S3, and is mandatory for Azure from the beginning.

* Although technically part of UploadFS 1.9.0, we'd like to note that the `azure` storage backend is now available and can be part of your `uploadfs` configuration for the `apostrophe-attachments` module.

* Server-side modules can now extend the buttons available in the "manage" modal of pieces without overriding templates, similar to the way they are extensible in the "edit" modal.

* UX fixes.

* Cropping an image through Apostrophe now works when attachments are stored in S3, Azure, etc.

* Date parsing does not generate `momentjs` warnings.

* Overrideable block in the outerLayout for the context menu.

* The `apostrophe-soft-redirects` module now accepts a `statusCode` option, which you may change to `301` to use hard redirects. Thanks to Leo Melzer.

## 2.54.3 (2018-05-02)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Contextual editing of pieces found in a `widget.html` template saves properly, as does contextual editing of a nested area added to the page for the first time.

* Previously executed migrations are remembered in a collection that persists, not just in a cache, avoiding extra work which could be extensive in a large database. Migrations are still required to be idempotent (they should detect whether they have any work to do, and do no harm if they are not needed again for a particular document).

* `apos.migrations.eachWidget` now delivers an accurate `dotPath`, which is crucial for the use of `apos.docs.db.update` with `$set`. No standard migrations in Apostrophe were using the feature until now.

## 2.54.2 (2018-04-24)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* A bug in the recently introduced `apostrophe-soft-redirects` module caused crashes in cases where the context page or piece had no `_url` property... which is an unusual situation (how did you get there exactly? Overrides are clearly involved), but it can happen in customized projects. Fixed.

## 2.54.1 (2018-04-24)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* A bug in Chrome 66 causes problems when selecting images in Apostrophe's media library. This bug did not appear before Chrome 66 and does not appear in other browsers. We resolved it by migrating to the use of the CSS grid feature in compatible browsers.

## 2.54.0 (2018-04-18)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Several performance improvements. In situations where Apostrophe formerly made expensive "matching nothing" queries, Apostrophe now either skips the entire query or uses an efficient query for a nonexistent `_id`, depending on whether the method in question has the right to cancel the entire operation.
* Resources released more completely by `apos.destroy`, which can now satisfy the expectations of `mocha` 5.x (no timeouts left active, etc). This was done by adding a `destroy` method to `uploadfs`.
* `range` schema fields behave better when there is no existing value.
* Save operation of a modal now triggers the global busy state to prevent race conditions and other unwanted behavior.
* Global busy state can now be pushed and popped, and modals utilize this, so that a modal can be used to gather information during the `saveContent` method of another modal.

## 2.53.0 (2018-04-11)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Do not send X-XSRF-TOKEN headers in an OPTIONS request. This change was mistakenly left out of the 2.52.0 release.
* The named anchor `main` can now be overridden via the `mainAnchor` nunjucks block.
* The `npmRootDir` option can be used to cause Apostrophe's module loading mechanism to seek npm modules in a location other than that specified by `rootDir` (or the project root). The new `localesDir` option of `apostrophe-i18n` does the same for localization. This makes it possible to use `rootDir` to specify an alternate location for everything else, i.e. the parent of `public`, `data`, `lib/modules`, etc. A necessary accommodation for the evolving `apostrophe-multisite` module.
* Raw HTML widgets now offer help text out of the box.
* The `express.static` middleware now runs before the `apostrophe-global` middleware and other "standard" Apostrophe middleware.
* Your own module-level `expressMiddleware` object can specify `{ when: 'beforeRequired', middleware: function(req, res, next) { ... })` to run before the required middleware as well. Note that this means no sessions, no users and no body parser. Most of the time you'll want those things.
* CSS adjustment to tabs in modals so they don't scroll in Firefox.
* Dropzones for empty areas are easier to drop onto.

## 2.52.0 (2018-03-30)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* No more 404's when slugs change for pages and pieces. Apostrophe now automatically implements "soft redirects" to the new URL of a page or piece. This is a major SEO improvement, with good support for any page or piece with a `._url` property. Note that this feature "learns" URLs over time as the pages and pieces are actually accessed, so if you decide to test it, remember that you must access the old URL at least once before you change it for the test. This feature can be disabled, if you really want to, by setting the `enable` option of the `apostrophe-soft-redirects` module to `false`.
* Indexed queries on the `parkedId` and `advisoryLock._id` properties. The lack of indexes for these properties could lead to full collection scans, so this is a significant performance boost on large databases.
* Apostrophe's anti-CSRF forgery X-XSRF-TOKEN header is no longer sent as part of an OPTIONS request, or as part of a cross-domain request. In the first case, cookies cannot be set by the server anyway, and in the second, we are communicating with a server that cannot see our session to verify it. In both cases, sending the headers was causing configuration headaches for developers. Thanks to Priyansh Gupta.
* A UI bug fix: the recently added "clone" button for widgets is no longer displayed for singletons, or for areas whose `limit` has been reached. Also, the `cloneable: false` option can be used to disable this feature for a particular area.
* UI bug fix: no more conflicts between the "Add Content" menu and the up/down/remove/etc. buttons for widgets.
* Clearer warnings and error messages.

## 2.51.1 (2018-03-27)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Do not crash when updating a doc if widgets exist but `_originalWidget` does not. This can happen in workflow scenarios where Apostrophe's `find` is bypassed.
* Accommodations for the forthcoming `apostrophe-optimizer` module.

## 2.51.0 (2018-03-21)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Widget fields may now have a `permission` property. If present, the user must have the named permission (such as `admin`), or they will not see that particular field in the editing dialog box. This is useful when a widget should be authorable by most users but has a sensitive field that should be restricted to a smaller group of users. Note that this feature already existed for schema fields of pieces and pages.
* Apostrophe again allows a named pipe to be specified via the `PORT` environment variable, for compatibility with Windows. Thanks to Jørgen M. Skogås for this fix.
* Apostrophe's default settings for the `bodyParser` option are now generous enough, in the case of JSON request bodies, to cover all reasonable editing scenarios in Apostrophe. This change also benefits the `apostrophe-headless` module.
* When Apostrophe must generate a `path` for a new page, it will look at the provided `slug` before it looks at the provided `title`. This is useful when titles in an import are of poor quality but slugs are unique. Prevents unnecessary numbered suffixes after both slugs and paths.
* The dropdown menu to add a widget no longer has a conflict with the hover menu offering widget controls such as "up," "down," etc. The hover menu does not appear while the dropdown menu is open.

## 2.50.0 (2018-03-14)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Clone button for widgets in areas, to save time when editing.
* New features for displaying the titles of array items when editing fields of type `array`. `titleField` may now use dot notation. In addition, if that isn't enough, you may use `listItemTemplate` to point to an alternative to the standard `arrayListItem.html` template, which you may use as a reference. In addition, both `titleField` dot notation and the custom `listItemTemplate` have full access to joins. Be sure to use cross-module include syntax if you don't want to put the template in `lib/modules/apostrophe-schemas/views`. For instance, you may write `listItemTemplate: 'my-module-name:listItemTemplate.html'`.
* Bug fix: modals are the right height when jQuery 3 is in use.
* CSS class added to the `h4` that displays the title in an `apostrophe-images` widget, for your CSS styling convenience. Thanks to Gareth Cooper.

## 2.49.0 (2018-03-09)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* New password reset feature. You will need to configure `apostrophe-email` and opt into this feature. See the new [Apostrophe password reset HOWTO](https://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/password-reset.html).
* Significant performance boost to the "reorganize" modal in situations where numerous pages are in the trash when using the `apostrophe-workflow` module.
* If widget ids are not provided when inserting new documents they are automatically generated. This makes [apostrophe-headless](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-headless) easier to use.

## 2.48.0 (2018-03-01)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* New `color` and `range` schema field types. `color` provides a color picker field allowing values compatible with CSS, etc. `range` provides an `<input type="range">` element and respects `min` and `max` options.
* New `apos.utils.log`, `apos.utils.info`, `apos.utils.debug`, `apos.utils.warn` and `apos.utils.error` methods. These are now used consistently throughout Apostrophe core, both in the server and in the browser. On the server, these methods wrap the corresponding methods of a `logger` object and you can inject your own via the `logger` option of the `apostrophe-utils` module. By default a logger object that wraps the `console` object is created. For convenience, if your logger has no `log` method, `apos.utils.log` will call `logger.info`. This allows many popular loggers like `winston` to be used without modification "out of the box."
* `modulesSubdir` option to specify subdir where local modules come from, overriding `lib/modules`. Useful when more than one `apos` object exists in a project.
* Major speedup to parked pages. Also eliminates spurious warnings about inefficient joins at startup.
* Refactored autocollapse behavior of admin bar into its own method for easier overrides.
* CSS fixes for improved usability.

## 2.47.0 (2018-02-14)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Developers now have the option to use jQuery 3. To enable jQuery 3, set the `jQuery` option of the `apostrophe-assets` module to the number `3`. We have packaged specific versions of jQuery 3 and jQuery UI which are known to be compatible with and tested with Apostrophe's UI, and we plan to use these in our own projects going forward. We will be making this change in the apostrophe boilerplate project. Of course Apostrophe's UI remains compatible with the older version of jQuery that loads by default. There is no bc break.

* When you join with pages, by using the virtual doc type `apostrophe-page`, the user is now invited to choose a page via a version of the reorganize dialog box, which has been made more user-friendly for this purpose. Autocomplete is still supported too.

* The reorganize dialog box is more pleasant to use. This dialog will continue to evolve to offer more of the functionality found in the "manage" dialog boxes for piece types.

* The page parking mechanism has been overhauled and improved. From now on, it is our recommendation that you set a unique `parkedId` for each parked page you configure for `apostrophe-pages`. This ensures that even if you change the slug in the configuration of the parked page, Apostrophe will still be able to understand that the page already exists and a new one should not be inserted. This is especially critical if using `apostrophe-workflow`, since you might decide to add or change locale prefixes at some point.

* The database connection keepalive mechanism now uses a query against an empty collection, rather than a server status call that the database user might not have permission to make.

* The `apos.utils.cssName` helper now preserves double dashes, as they are a common feature in modern CSS frameworks.

* There is now an `apostrophe-areas:widgetBase.html` file which can be extended block by block in a project-level `lib/modules/apostrophe-areas/views/widget.html` file. New overrideable methods have also been added to simplify adding custom classes programmatically to the wrapper and the widget itself without overriding any templates.

* It is now possible to configure select elements (we do not recommend more than one) to be displayed inline with the other widget controls, i.e. up, down, delete, etc. The back end of this is left to the developer, however you can check out the still-evolving [apostrophe-personas](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-personas) module for an example. This feature is primarily meant for modules like `apostrophe-personas` that impact all widgets in a general way.

## 2.46.1 (2018-01-30)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Attachment fields now save properly when directly part of the schema of a widget. A bug was introduced in version 2.42.0 when the `length` property was added to attachments. A fix made long ago to `apos.utils.clonePermanent` on the server side was also needed on the browser side.

## 2.46.0 (2018-01-25)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The "Copy" button of pieces now copies areas that do not explicitly appear in the schema, and works correctly when an `apostrophe-pieces` module is set `contextual: true`. Overrideable methods are provided for those who need to copy more than schema fields and top-level areas. We do not copy every property by default because this could have unforeseen consequences; we copy only what is in the schema, plus top-level areas because these have always been supported without an explicit schema in templates.

* It is now possible to secure widget properties so that they are not visible to end users if you do not choose to output them in the markup. To do that, set the `playerData` option of your widget module to `false`, or to an array of properties that **should** be visible in the `data` JSON attribute so that they are passed to the `play()` method. Normally widget properties are public information, intended for display, but this technique is useful if you have a `username` and `password` for use in fetching an external feed in a server-side `load` method, for instance. **Note that to allow widget editing to function, everything is still passed in `data` if the user has editing privileges for the widget.** So if you seek to verify this feature, be sure to check as a logged-out user, or a user without editing permissions for that content.

* It is now easy to override the `fieldset` markup for Apostrophe schemas. Just copy `lib/modules/apostrophe-schemas/views/fieldset.html` to your project-level version of that path and edit it. However, please note that you must continue to have an outer wrapper element with the given attributes.

* Apostrophe's codebase now passes `eslint`. In the process many cases of callback errors being ignored were fixed, as well as global variable leaks.

* Apostrophe's `apos.locks.lock` and `apos.locks.unlock` methods now support promises.

## 2.45.0 (2018-01-11)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The `apostrophe-caches` module has better, clearer documentation and it now supports promises.
* All modules can now conveniently send email using [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/). The new `email` method of all modules renders a template in that module's `views` folder, exactly as you would hope it would, and also automatically generates a plaintext version for the occasional user who does not view HTML email. The automatically generated versions include links properly.
* Extending `apostrophe-images-widgets` and other pieces widgets is easier. If your widget name doesn't correspond to the kind of piece you are displaying, a helpful error appears explaining that you need to set `piecesModuleName`. Adding fields to these widgets now behaves reasonably. Also, if you add fields to `apostrophe-images` or `apostrophe-files` at project level, this now behaves as expected too.
* A locking mechanism has been added during the movement of pages in the page tree. This prevents rare race conditions that could previously have resulted in duplicate page ranks, although the design of the page tree is such that more serious consequences were always avoided.
* Text justification options for ckeditor are now standard in our build of ckeditor. Of course you still need to configure `sanitize-html` properly when using them.
* Any widgets module may now specify a `wrapperTemplate` option. That template is rendered instead of the standard `apostrophe-areas:widget.html` template, and can use `extends` and override blocks found in that template. This is useful if you need to set attributes of the outer wrapper element of the widget.
* The migration added in 2.43.0 to address file permissions for existing attachments in the trash has been greatly accelerated, helpful on large sites.
* Better error messages for `min` and `max` options of some schema field types; provisions for expanded error messages in general.
* For those using the `testModule` option to test their own npm modules in the context of Apostrophe, a default shortname is automatically provided.
* Fixed missing space in admin bar markup, thanks to arlecchino.

## 2.44.0 (2017-12-15)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Apostrophe's AJAX filter features for `apostrophe-pieces-pages` now support "Load More" buttons and infinite scroll.

To add a "Load More" button:

1. Wrap a new element inside your data-apos-ajax-context element around the content that makes up the current "page" of results. This should not wrap around filter links or the "Load More" button itself.
2. Give that new element the `data-apos-ajax-append` attribute.
3. Add `append=1` to the query string of your Load More button. Example:

```
{% if data.currentPage < data.totalPages %}
  <a href="{{ data.url }} | build({ page: data.currentPage + 1, append: 1 })">Load More...</a>
{% endif %}
```

To progressively enhance this for infinite scroll, add a `data-apos-ajax-infinite-scroll` attribute to the button.

Note that we do this via progressive enhancement of a "Load More" button so that Google can still reach and index all of the pages (SEO).

* Attachment schema fields now respect the new `fileGroup` and `fileGroups` properties. If `fileGroup` is set to `images`, then only image types (GIF, JPEG, PNG) are accepted; if it is set to `office` only typical business file types are accepted. Note that we have always rejected files that didn't appear on the list for either type. You can also specify `fileGroups` as an array.
* `fileGroup: 'image'` is now configured by default for `apostrophe-images`, as was always intended but incorrectly implemented in the past.
* Attachment schema fields now respect the new `extension` and `extensions` properties. The former is handy if you only want to allow one extension, the latter if you want to allow more than one. The extensions must be those specified for `fileGroups` in the default configuration of `apostrophe-attachments` or your override of it (all lower case; JPEG is `jpg`; no period).
* The `addDocReferences` migration has been parallelized, as this one-time migration can be time-consuming on a large site.
* Broken `less` calculation fixed, thanks to Antoine COMBES.

## 2.43.0 (2017-12-12)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* When a "file" or "image" is moved to the trash, the attachment in question now becomes inaccessible. This is particularly important to stop access to obsolete PDFs, which Google loves to access. If the file or image is removed from the trash, the attachment becomes available again. In the case of images, the 1/6th size remains available by default to provide preview when viewing the trash. If the same attachment is referenced by more than one doc, which can happen due to "Copy" operations or `apostrophe-workflow`, it remains available until all such docs are in the trash.

* Parked properties are no longer editable in page settings. Since every site restart always wiped them out anyway, this is a bug fix, not a truly new behavior. With this change, you can finally set `type: 'home'` when `park`ing the home page, and remove `home` from your page types dropdown.

* The `apostrophe-jobs` module now offers a `runNonBatch` method, which is useful for long-running operations that don't involve iterating over many instances of the same type of object.

* Improvements to background image positioning for images widgets.

* A block has been added to override the `lang` attribute easily. Thanks to Ayho.

* The `imgAlt` block can now be used to conveniently override the `alt` attribute of images when overriding `widget.html` for `apostrophe-images-widgets`. Thanks to Raphaël DiRago.

* The `required` option now works properly for fields of type `array` (there must be at least one item in the array).

* Improved error messages for unblessed widget schemas. These are usually related to a widget that is no longer in the page template but appears in the database.

* A UI bug that caused tabs to become invisible when returning from nested dialog boxes has been fixed.

* Filters for "select" fields now default to "no opinion," rather than the default choice. This is the normal behavior for other field types.

* Even more promise support! `apos.attachments.insert`, `pieces.trash` and `pieces.rescue` all return promises if no callback is given.

* A YouTube embed unit test was removed to ensure consistent results in Travis CI, which is once again in routine use.

## 2.42.1 (2017-11-24)

Unit tests passing.

* Use of a capitalized filename that should have been lowercase in a `require` briefly broke Apostrophe's initialization on Linux. We are correcting this by reinstating CI in a Linux environment.

## 2.42.0 (2017-11-22)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Promises have landed in Apostrophe. Calling `toArray`, `toObject`, `toDistinct` or `toMongo` on an Apostrophe cursor *without a callback* will return a promise. That promise will resolve to the expected result.

In addition, `docs.insert`, `docs.update`, `pieces.insert`, `pieces.update`, and `pages.insert` will all return a promise if invoked without a callback.

These are the most frequently invoked functions in Apostrophe that formerly required callbacks.

**As always with promises, be sure to catch errors with `.catch()`** at some level.

Note that **the `await` keyword can now be used with these methods**, as long as you're running Node.js 8.x or newer or using Babel to provide that language feature.

* Apostrophe's custom `Split` CKEditor toolbar control now works correctly in 2.x. You can give your users the `Split` control to allow them to break up a large rich text widget in order to insert other types of widget "in the middle." Note that the control name is now capitalized to match the way other CKEditor toolbar buttons are named.

* You may now specify `_url: 1` or `_nameOfJoin: 1` in a projection when using Apostrophe's `find()` methods. Native MongoDB projections naturally can't see these "computed properties" because they don't live in the database — they are computed "on the fly" after documents are fetched. However, Apostrophe now automatically adds the right underlying fields to the projection.

Only `_url` and the names of `joinByOne` or `joinByArray` fields are supported. It does not make sense to use a projection on `people` to locate IDs that are actually attached to `products` via `joinByOneReverse` or `joinByArrayReverse`.

*This feature does not conflict with legitimate uses of MongoDB projections because Apostrophe discards all properties beginning with `_` when writing to the database, except for `_id`.*

* The `length` property of an Apostrophe `attachment` object is now correctly populated with the original file size. Thanks to David Keita. Note that images are also made available in many scaled sizes. Also the original may be replaced with a correctly rotated version, in which case `length` will not match. So the most useful scenario for this property is likely to be in working with office formats, especially PDF which can sometimes be very large.

* Fixed bug in the `isEmpty` methods for areas and singletons. Thanks to David Keita.

## 2.41.0 (2017-11-17)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* The new `apostrophe-jobs` module, part of the core of Apostrophe, provides a progress meter mechanism and the ability to stop long-running user-initiated operations, such as batch operations on pieces. See the [jobs module documentation](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/modules/apostrophe-jobs/index.html). You can also refer to the pieces module for examples if you wish to use this for your own long-running user-initiated operations.
* Batch operations now have more robust support for "select everything." A number of bugs related to multiple selection of pieces have been fixed in a refactoring that made this code much more maintainable and predictable.
* The option of pushing an asset of type `template`, which never worked in 2.x and was never used by Apostrophe, has been removed for clarity. Our preference is for rendering assets on the server side dynamically when needed, rather than pushing many templates into the DOM on every page load.
* An `.editorconfig` file has been added. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* Parking a page only pushes permanent properties. `_defaults` and `_children` should never have been in the database; they are of course still interpreted to decide what should happen, but the properties *themselves* did not belong in the database. (You may need to write a migration if they are already there and this is causing issues for you.)
* Scrolling UI behavior of pieces improved; various other UI touch-ups. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.
* `newBrowserCalls` helper for `push` module can be used when you want JavaScript calls queued up with `req.browserCall` to be executed in an AJAX update of just part of a page.
* Fixed bugs affecting access to the published/unpublished batch operations and similar.

## 2.40.0 (2017-11-10)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Support for "select everything" when managing pieces. Once you check the box to select everything on the current page, you are given a secondary option to select everything that matches your current criteria. This works both when choosing pieces for widgets and when working with batch operations like "trash" or "rescue."
* Fixed various bugs affecting combinations of "select all on page", the chooser and working with images.
* Improvements to batch operations on pieces. The `requiredField` property is checked correctly, and the new `onlyIf` property allows for passing a function that accepts the doc type name and decides whether the button should appear. Multiword action names are properly camelcased. New "success" and "dataSource" options to `batchSimple` allow for carrying out additional operations afterward as well as gathering input independently at the start. And batch operations are composed late so that other modules can add them.
* The `self.api` and `self.html` methods of `apostrophe-context` and `apostrophe-modal` now support a syntax for making cross-module API calls, just like templates.
* Addressed moog versioning issue with latest npm that caused errors about "synth.instanceOf" not being found depending on the state of your npm cache.

## 2.39.2 (2017-11-02)

Unit tests passing.

Startup-related regression tests passing.

* The `APOS_MONGODB_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable can now be set to `debug`, `info` or anything else supported by the MongoDB driver's `Logger.setLevel` method. This is helpful for debugging database issues at the lowest level.

## 2.39.1 (2017-11-01)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Factored out a `getBaseUrl` method for `apostrophe-pages`, allowing
overrides of this that pay attention to `req`.
* Report `pageBeforeSend` errors and failures to load the global doc properly, don't silently tolerate them.
* Documentation corrections. Thanks to Frederik Ekelund.


## 2.39.0 (2017-10-24)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Easier access to options. Introduced the `getOption` method to all modules. Calling `self.getOption(req, 'sizes.large')` from your module's server-side JavaScript code, or just `module.getOption('sizes.large')` from Nunjucks, will return the value of `self.options.sizes.large` for that module. You may also pass an array of keys, i.e. `module.getOption([ 'sizes', 'large' ])`. This method is tolerant, it returns undefined if any part of the path does not exist. See also the new [apostrophe-override-options](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-override-options) which extends this feature to support customizing the returned value for any option based on the current page type, page settings, piece settings and locale. * Helpful warning when maximum area/widget loader recursion level is reached. Always use projections when adding joins to your schema to avoid a performance hit due to runaway recursion.
* New `disabledTypes` option to `apostrophe-pages`, primarily for use with `apostrophe-override-options`.
* Fixed UI bug relating to area menus at the bottom of the page.
* Fixed bug that caused a crash when invalid usernames attempted to log in. Thanks to Arthur.

## 2.38.0 (2017-10-16)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Various schema field validators for required fields no longer crash on the browser side if a property is nonexistent, as opposed to being the expected empty string.
* Buttons for editing pieces widgets now use less confusing language.
* Accommodations for the `apostrophe-headless` module (arriving later today), including factoring out certain login-related and piece-related functionality to separate methods in order to make it easier to introduce RESTful APIs for the same features.
* Unit tests no longer drop the entire test database between suites; instead they drop the collections. Also the unit test timeout can be set via an environment variable. This accommodates testing against various cloud databases with security that precludes dropping entire databases.
* Lots of new content in the README to get folks who haven't been to the documentation site yet a little more excited.

## 2.37.2 (2017-10-04)

Unit tests passing.

Conflict resolution and template extension-related regression tests passing.

* The conflict resolution feature, which helps users avoid conflicts in which neither is successfully able to save content reliably by explaining that two users are editing the same doc and offering the option of taking control, can now be disabled by setting the `conflictResolution` option of the `apostrophe-docs` module explicitly to `false`. **We do not recommend** the use of this option in normal practice, however it has valid applications in automated testing.

* Recently a bug was introduced in which extensions other than `.html` or `.njk` did not work in `include` statements, etc. in Nunjucks templates unless the file in question existed in the project-level version of the module including it. The full cascade of template folder paths is now supported for these explicit extensions, including searching `viewsFolderFallback`.

## 2.37.1 (2017-09-27)

Unit tests passing.

Piece- and schema-related regression tests passing.

* Filters are now available for schema fields of type `integer`. You can configure these for the manage view, or for pieces-pages, exactly as you would for other field types. Previously this feature existed but did not function properly, so this is a patchlevel release rather than a minor version bump.
* Previously, when viewing pieces in the trash, the batch operation button initially read "Trash Items" rather than "Rescue Items." It did not match the selected operation in the select element, and did not perform the needed operation of rescuing items unless you switched operations and switched back again. This has been fixed.

## 2.37.0 (2017-09-25)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* New feature: you may now use the `.njk` file extension in addition to `.html` for your Nunjucks templates. In order to maximize the usefulness of this feature in the context of existing Apostrophe code, `.njk` is still checked for even if `.html` was specified when calling the `render` method. `.njk` is a convention adopted by the Nunjucks community and is supported by some syntax highlighters.
* Bug fix: drag-and-drop reordering and movement of widgets is once again functional. (The arrows worked all along.)
* Bug fix: drag-and-drop targets for widgets residing in areas nested in other widgets now appear and function properly.


## 2.36.3 (2017-09-20)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* If an oembed provider responds with an HTTP error and a response that is not parseable as XML or JSON, Apostrophe no longer crashes (this fix is actually in the oembetter npm module). This fixes crashes on non-embeddable YouTube videos.
* If the oembed provider issues a 401 or 404 error, a relevant error message is given. Otherwise the generic error icon is still given.

## 2.36.2 (2017-09-19)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Dragging and dropping will now automatically scroll the "reorganize" dialog box.
* Attempts to drag a page above or below the "Home" page in "reorganize" no longer cause a restart. Also, the interface rejects them gracefully.
* Attempts to drag a page below the trashcan are rejected gracefully.
* When `trashInSchema` is active, the "traditional" trash can sorts below "in-context" trash, and the traditional trash can receives the special label "Legacy Trash" to reduce confusion.
* When on page two (or higher) in the "manage" view of pieces, performing a text search now correctly resets to page one.
* Throw an error at startup if a forbidden schema field name is used in `addFields` configuration. For instance, `type` is forbidden for widget schemas, while `docPermissions` is forbidden for doc type schemas, and `_id` is forbidden for both. Note that field names like `title` that are already in the schema are *not* forbidden because re-adding a schema field replaces it, which is often done to change the label, etc. So we'll be adding more documentation about these to help developers avoid surprises if their intention was an entirely new field.

## 2.36.1 (2017-09-13)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Spurious conflict resolution warnings for pieces fixed.
* Notifications are spaced properly, and in the upper right corner as intended, on all screens.
* Reorganize feature: upgraded to jqtree 1.4.2. Regression testing found no bc breaks.
* A debugging convenience: the `log(true)` cursor filter logs MongoDB criteria objects resulting from the cursor in question to the console.

## 2.36.0 (2017-09-12)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* You may now set the `skipInitialModal` option for any widget module to `true` in order to avoid displaying the editing dialog box when the widget is first added. This makes sense if the widget has a useful default behavior, or consists of a contextually editable rich text sub-widget with a "style" select element you might or might not need to set every time.
* Fields in Apostrophe's schema-driven forms now receive globally unique `id` attributes, and the `for` attributes of `label` elements now reference them properly.

## 2.35.1 (2017-09-08)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* Intermittent "not blessed" errors when editing joins in widget schemas have been corrected by blessing all widget schemas at page serve time, just as we already bless all doc type schemas at page serve time. Blessing them when the individual routes fire is problematic because of probable race conditions with sessions.

## 2.35.0 (2017-09-06)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

* `apos.areas.isEmpty(data.page, 'body')` will now tell you if that area is considered empty (it contains no widgets, or the widgets consider themselves empty).

* The new `controls` option may be passed to any widget, via `apos.singleton` or via the configuration for that specific widget type in an `apos.area` call. In this example, the widget cannot be removed, cannot be moved, and has its controls positioned at the upper right instead of the upper left:

```
{{
  apos.singleton(data.page, 'footer', 'apostrophe-rich-text', {
    controls: {
      removable: false,
      movable: false,
      position: 'top-right'
      }
    }
  })
}}
```

The `position` suboption may be set to `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left` or `bottom-right`.

The `removable` and `movable` suboptions are primarily intended for singletons.

* By popular demand, the `insert` and `update` methods of pieces now pass the piece to their callback as the second argument.

* Better CSS reset for Apostrophe's admin UI.

* `callOne` added for convenience when you want to invoke a method normally invoked by `callAll` in the same way, but for only one module. Thanks to Arthur.

* If an attachment does not exist, `apos.attachments.url` no longer results in a template error page. Instead a fallback icon is displayed and an error message is logged. Developers should still always check whether attachments and joined objects still exist in their templates. Thanks to Raphaël DiRago.

* Notifications within modals move to lower right corner of modal for readability.

* Cleaned up font paths.

* Accommodations for the latest release of the separately published apostrophe-workflow module.

## 2.34.3 (2017-08-31)

Unit tests passing.

Regression tests passing.

A bug was fixed that prevented nested area editing. The bug appeared in version 2.34.0.

Note that editing an area on the page has never been possible when it is part of the schema of an array field. That is not a new issue. It is being tracked and discussed. Today's fix was for a regression that impacted all nested areas.

## 2.34.2 (2017-08-29)

All tests passing.

Fixed a bug that generated an error message regarding conflict resolution when attempting to edit an area inside a piece editor dialog box.

## 2.34.1 (2017-08-28)

All tests passing.

Fixed an issue impacting unit test harness only. It didn't come up initially because it had to do with automatically creating `test/node_modules`, which existed our dev environment.

No code changes outside of tests.

## 2.34.0 (2017-08-28)

All tests passing.

* Conflict resolution has been added to Apostrophe. When two users attempt to edit the same document, whether "in context" on the page or via a dialog box, Apostrophe now makes the latecomer aware of the issue and gives them the option to take control of the document after warning that the first party could lose work.

Since the first user may have simply abandoned their work, Apostrophe also indicates how long it has been since the first user last made a change.

If the same user attempts to edit a document in two tabs or windows, something very similar happens, although the message is different.

* In a related change, Apostrophe does not begin attempting to save an area on the page until the user interacts with it for the first time. This fixes many commonly reported frustrating situations in which one user is editing and the other is logged in but merely looking at the page, creating a ping-pong exchange of save requests.

* Apostrophe's unit tests have been restructured so that a single test file can be run conveniently, via `mocha test/docs.js`, for instance, and there is no longer a need for us to update `test/test.js` every time a test is added. Also, the unit tests use the same `apos.tasks.getReq` and `apos.tasks.getAnonReq` methods that are used by real-life command line tasks, which provide a more faithful simulation of an Express request object and one we anticipate extending as needed.

## 2.33.1 (2017-08-16)

All tests passing.

* Fixed potential crash in version pruning mechanism.

## 2.33.0 (2017-08-10)

All tests passing.

* The login page can be disabled via the new `localLogin` option of the `apostrophe-login` module. Set it explicitly to `false` to disable the login URL completely.
* Refactoring: the `apostrophe-login` module now has an `afterLogin` method which takes care of invoking the `loginAfterLogin` callAll method on all modules that have one, and then redirecting appropriately. This code was factored out to make it easier to use in the new [apostrophe-passport](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-passport) module, which allows the use of almost any [Passport](http://passportjs.org)-based strategy, such as Facebook login, Google login, Github login, etc.
* `apos.users.ensureGroup` now delivers the group to its callback as the second argument.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

## 2.32.0 (2017-08-08)

All tests passing.

* Fixed an S3 asset bundle generation bug that caused `.less` files to be imported with the wrong file extension if the `public` folder did not yet exist at the time `--create-bundle` was used. Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* Also added an `apostrophe-caches:clear` task to aid in testing various functionality. You must specify the cache name since caches may or may not even be known to Apostrophe at task startup time based on whether and when code calls `.get` for each cache name.

## 2.31.0 (2017-08-07)

All tests passing.

* The new `testModule: true` option causes Apostrophe to supply much of the boilerplate for a published npm apostrophe module that wants to test itself as part of an apostrophe instance, i.e. apostrophe-workflow, apostrophe-caches-redis, etc. See those modules for examples of usage. This is a feature for those writing their own npm modules that wish to unit test by initializing Apostrophe and loading the module in question.

* Fixed caching bugs, notably the oembed cache, which is now operating properly. Oembed responses, such as YouTube iframe markup, are now cached for an hour as originally intended which improves frontend loading time.

* Page type changes only refreshed the schema fields on the first change — now they do it properly after every change.

* Page type changes use the "busy" mechanism while refreshing the schema fields to prevent user interface race conditions and avoid user confusion.

* `trash` is never offered as a schema field of the `global` doc (mainly a concern with `apostrophe-workflow`).

## 2.30.0 (2017-08-02)

All tests passing.

It is now easier to set up Redis or another alternative session store:

```
'apostrophe-express': {
  session: {
    secret: 'your-secret-here',
    store: {
      name: 'connect-redis',
      options: {
        // redis-specific options here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For bc, you can still pass a live instance of a store as the `store` option, but this way is easier; all you have to do is `npm install --save` your connect-compatible session store of choice and configure it.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

## 2.29.2 (2017-08-02)

All tests passing.

* Overrideable widgetControlGroups method takes (req, widget, options) allowing for better control when customizing these buttons.
* The `createControls` option of the `apostrophe-pages` module is now respewcted properly.

## 2.29.1 (2017-07-31)

All tests passing.

* Fixed a short-lived issue with the reorganize feature.

## 2.29.0 (2017-07-31)

All tests passing.

This is a significant update containing various accommodations required by the shortly forthcoming Apostrophe 2.x version of the `apostrophe-workflow` module, as well as other recent enhancements in our queue.

* Editing an area "in context" on the page when it is part of a widget or piece will always work, even if `contextual: true` was not set. That property is optional and prevents the area from also appearing in the dialog box for editing the content type.

* Multiple select filters are now available for the "manage" view of any piece type. Just like configuring single-select filters, except that you'll add `multiple: true` to the relevant object in your `addFilters` configuration for the module. Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* When editing a previous selection of pieces for a join or widget, you can also easily edit them without locating them again in the manage view.

* "Next" and "previous" links can now be easily added to your `show.html` pages for pieces. Just set the `next` and `previous` options for your `apostrophe-pieces-pages` subclass to `true`, or to an object with a `projection` property for best performance. This will populate `data.previous` and `data.next` in your `show.html` template. *For blogs they may seem backwards; they refer to relative position on the index page, and blogs are reverse-chronological. Just switch the terms on the front end in your template in cases where they appear confusing.*

* There is now a "pages" option on the admin bar, for cases where "reorganize" is not visible because "Page Settings" is not accessible to the user for the current page.

* If the `trashInSchema` option is set to `true` when configuring `apostrophe-docs`, pages that are in the trash retain their position in the page tree rather than moving to a separate "trash" subtree. In the "reorganize" interface, they are grouped into trash cans displayed beneath each parent page, rather than a single global trash can. This is necessary for the new workflow module and also helpful in any situation where trying to find pages in the trash is more troublesome than explaining this alternative approach.

When `trashInSchema` is `true`, users can also change the trash status of a piece or page via "Page Settings" or the "Edit" dialog box of the piece, and it is possible to access "Page Settings" for any page via "Reorganize."

* The buttons displayed for each widget in an Apostrophe area can be adjusted via the `addWidgetControlGroups` option of the `apostrophe-areas` module, which can be used to introduce additional buttons.

* Empty `beforeMove` and `afterMove` methods have been added to the `apostrophe-pages` module for the convenience of modules using `improve` to enhance it.

* The `apostrophe-doc-type-manager` module now has `getEditPermissionName` and `getAdminPermissionName` methods. These can be overridden by subclasses. For instance, all page subtypes return `edit-apostrophe-page` for the former because page types can be changed.

* `apos.destroy(function() { ... })` may be called to shut down a running Apostrophe instance. This does **not** delete any data. It simply releases the database connection, HTTP server port, etc. This mechanism is extensible by implementing an `apostropheDestroy` method in your own module.

* `before` option for `expressMiddleware`. As before any module can provide middleware via an `expressMiddleware` property which may be a function or array of functions. In addition, if that property is an object, it may also have a `before` subproperty specifying a module whose middleware should run after it. In this case the actual middleware function or functions must be in a `middleware` subproperty.

* `apos.instancesOf(name)` returns an array of modules that extend `name` or a subclass of it. `apos.instanceOf(object, name)` returns true if the given `object` is a moog instance of `name` or a subclass of it.

* `apos.permissions.criteria` can now supply MongoDB criteria restricted to the types the user can edit when a general permission name like `edit` or `edit-doc` is asked for. *This was never a security bug because permissions for actual editing were checked when individual edits occurred. The change makes it easier to display lists of editable content of mixed types.*

* Extending the indexes of Apostrophe's `aposDocs` collection is easier to achieve in modules that use `improve` to extend `apostrophe-docs`.

* Removed tests for obsolete, unsupported Node.js 0.10.x. Node.js 4.x is now the minimum version. *We do not intend to break ES5 compliance in 2.x, however testing old versions of Node that are not maintained with security patches in any freely available repository is not practical.*

* `insert` method for `apos.attachments`, mirroring the other modules better. Thanks to Arthur Agombart.

## 2.28.0 (2017-07-17)

All tests passing.

* Notifications are available, replacing the use of `alert`. This feature is primarily for Apostrophe's own administrative features; you can use it when extending the editing UI. Call `apos.notify('message')` to display a simple message. You can specify several `type` options such as `error` and `info`, and you can also use `%s` wildcards. Everything is localized on the server side. [See the documentation for more information](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/modules/apostrophe-notifications/browser-apostrophe-notifications.html#trigger). Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.
* The `apostrophe-images` widget now provides a focal point editor. See the new [responsive images HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/responsive-images.html). Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.
* UX: clicking "edit" on an image you have already selected no longer deselects the image. Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.
* Bug fix: corrected issue that sometimes prevented joins with pages from editing properly.
* Bug fix: added sort index on `level` and `rank`, preventing MongoDB errors on very large page trees.
* UX: a complete URL is suggested at startup when testing locally. Thanks to Alex Gleason.

## 2.27.1 (2017-06-28)

All tests passing.

* Fixed recently introduced bug preventing page type switching.

## 2.27.0 (2017-06-26)

All tests passing.

* Lazy schema field configuration, in general and especially for joins. No more need to specify `idField`, `idsField`, `relationshipsField` or even `label` for your schema fields. `withType` can be inferred too in many cases, depending on the name of the join field. You can still specify all of the details by hand.

Also, for reverse joins, there is a new `reverseOf` option, allowing you to just specify the name of the join you are reversing. This is much easier to understand than specifying the `idField` of the other join. However that is still permitted.

Lazy configuration is in place for doc types (like pages and pieces) and widget types. It can be extended to other uses of schemas by calling the new validation methods.

* ckeditor 4.6.2. Resolves #896: you can now create links properly in Microsoft Edge. Our policy is now to check in periodically with new ckeditor releases and just make sure they are compatible with our editor skin before releasing them.

* `apos.areas.fromRichText` can be used to create an area with a single rich text widget from a trusted string of HTML. Not intended for mixed media, just rich text. Related: both `fromRichText` and `fromPlaintext` now correctly give their widgets an `_id` property.

## 2.26.1 (2017-06-12)

All tests passing.

* Fixed short-lived bug introduced in 2.26.0 re: detecting missing widget types.

## 2.26.0 (2017-06-12)

All tests passing.

* Do not crash on missing widget types, print good warning messages.

* Complete implementation of the [explicitOrder](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/modules/apostrophe-docs/server-apostrophe-cursor.html#explicit-order) cursor filter, replacing a nonfunctional implementation.

* If the mongodb connection is lost, the default behavior is now to retry it forever, so when MongoDB does get restarted Apostrophe will find it. In addition, a `connect` object may be passed to the `apostrophe-db` module to be passed on to the MongoDB connect call.

* Spaces added between DOM attributes for better HTML5 compliance.

* `required` subfields are now enforced when editing fields of type `array`.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of much of the work in this release.

## 2.25.0 (2017-05-26)

All tests passing.

* There is now a `readOnly` option for the standard schema field types. Thanks to Michelin for contributing this feature.

* Apostrophe now displays useful warnings and, in some cases, errors at startup when schemas are improperly configured. This is particularly useful if you have found it frustrating to configure joins correctly. We are continuing to deepen the coverage here.

* In the manage view, the "published" and "trash" filters now always offer both "yes" and "no," regardless of whether anything is available in those categories. This is necessary because these are the respective defaults, and these are also unusual cases in which it is actually interesting to know nothing is available.

## 2.24.0 (2017-05-05)

All tests passing.

There is now an `object` schema field type. It works much like the `array` schema field type, however there is just one object, represented as an object property of the doc in the database. Thanks to Michelin's development team for contributing this feature.

## 2.23.2 (2017-04-30)

All tests passing.

The options object of `enhanceDate` is now passed on to `pikaday`. Considered a bug fix since the options object was erroneously ignored.

* 2.23.1

All tests passing.

cleanCss needs to know that the output CSS files are going to live in apos-minified in order to correctly parse `@import` statements that pull in plain .css files. Also, the mechanism for prefixing URLs in CSS code was not applied at the correct stage of the bundling process (the minify stage), which broke the ability to reference fonts, images, etc. via URLs beginning with /modules when using an S3 asset bundle.

## 2.23.0 (2017-04-24)

All tests passing.

* The "manage" view of `apostrophe-pieces` now supports robust filters, in the same way they were already supported on the front end for `apostrophe-pieces-pages`. Use the `addFilters` option to configure them. There is bc with existing filters that relied on the old assumption that manage filters have a boolean API. However now you can specify any field with a cursor filter, which includes most schema fields, notably including joins.

Note that since all of the options are presented in a dropdown, not all fields are good candidates for this feature.

The "manage" view filters now refresh to reflect only the options that still make sense based on the other filters you have selected, reducing user frustration.

See [reusable content with pieces](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started/reusable-content-with-pieces.html) for more information and examples.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* `apos.utils.isFalse` allows you to check for values that are strictly `=== false` in templates.

* `apos.utils.startCase` converts property names to English, roughly speaking. It is used as a fallback if a filter does not have a `label` property. This is primarily for bc, you should add a `label` property to your fields.

* Production now matches the dev environment with regard to relative URLs in LESS files, such as those used to specify background images or font files. Previously the behavior was different in dev and production, which is a bug.

* You can now pass a `less` option to `apostrophe-assets`, which is merged with the options given to `less.render` both in dev and production. You can use this, for instance, to enable `strictMath`.

* `apostrophe.oembed`'s `fetch` method now propagates its `options` object to `oembetter` correctly. Thanks to Fotis Paraskevopoulos.

## 2.22.0 (2017-04-11)

All tests passing.

* Apostrophe now supports publishing CSS and JS assets via S3 rather than serving them directly.

Apostrophe already had an option to build asset "bundles" and deploy them at startup, as described in our [cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html). However this serves the assets from the cloud webserver, such as a Heroku dyno or EC2 instance. It is now possible to serve the assets from Amazon S3.

See the [updated cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html) for details.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* Enforce string field `min` and `max` properties on server side.

* When validation of a form with tabs fails, such as a pieces edit modal, activate the correct tab and scroll to the first error in that tab.

* thanks to Ludovic Bret for fixing a bug in the admin bar markup.

## 2.21.0 (2017-04-11)

All tests passing.

* For a small performance boost, `defer` option can be set to `true` when configuring any widget module.
This defers calls to the `load` method until just before the page is rendered, allowing a single query
to fetch them all in simple cases. This is best applied
to the `apostrophe-images-widgets` module and similar widgets. It should not be applied if you wish
to access the results of the join in asynchronous code, because they are not available until the last
possible moment.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

* You can also set `deferImageLoading` to `true` for the `apostrophe-globals` module if you want the
same technique to be applied when loading the `global` doc's widgets. This does not always yield a
performance improvement.

* Bug fix: if two crops of the same image were present in separate widgets on a page, only one of the crops would be seen in template code. This issue has been resolved.

## 2.20.3 (2017-04-05)

All tests passing.

* The search filter is once again available when choosing images. This involved a deeper fix to modals: filters for sliding modals were not being properly captured and hoisted into the shared part of the outer div. This is now being done exactly as it is done for the controls (buttons) and the instructions.

To avoid incompatibility with existing uses of `self.$filters`, such as in the manage modal, they are captured to `self.$modalFilters`. A small change to the manage modal was needed to take advantage of this.

* Moved a warning message from `console.log` to `console.error`. `stdout` should never be used for warnings and errors. Moving toward clean output so that command line tasks can be safely used in pipelines.

## 2.20.2 (2017-03-31)

All tests passing.

Improved UI for editing widgets. The edit button is no longer separate from the area-related controls such as up, down, etc. This reduces clutter and reduces difficulty in accessing widgets while editing.

## 2.20.1 (2017-03-27)

All tests passing.

When autocompleting doc titles to add them to a join, Apostrophe again utilizes search result quality to display the best results first.

## 2.20.0 (2017-03-20)

All tests passing.

This is a significant update with two useful new features and various minor improvements.

* Support for batch uploads. The `apostrophe-images` and `apostrophe-files` modules now implement batch uploads by default.

When you click "New File" or "New Image," you now go directly to the file browser, and if you select multiple files they are uploaded without a modal dialog appearing for each one; the title and slug are populated from the filename, and that's that.

You can also drag one or more files directly to the chooser/manager modal.

If you are choosing files or images for a widget, they are automatically selected after a batch upload.

This feature can be disabled by setting the `insertViaUpload` option to `false` for `apostrophe-images` or `apostrophe-files`. If you are adding `required` fields to `apostrophe-images` or `apostrophe-files`, then batch uploading is not the best option for you because it would bypass that.

**If you wish, you can enable the feature for your own `apostrophe-pieces` modules that have an `attachment` field in their schema by setting the `insertViaUpload` option to `true`.** However please note that this does not currently do anything for pieces that refer to an image or file indirectly via widget.

* Global preference editing, and a standard UI to roll back to earlier versions of global content. There is now a "Global Content" admin bar button. By default, this launches the version rollback dialog box for shared global content.

However, if you use `addFields` to add schema fields to the `apostrophe-global` module, this button instead launches an editing modal where you can edit those fields, and also offers a "Versions" button accessible from there.

Global preferences set in this way are accessible in all situations where `data.global` is available. This is very useful for creating project-wide preference settings.

All the usual features of schemas can be used, including `groupFields`. Of course, if you choose to use joins or widgets in global content, you should keep the performance impact in mind.

* Various UX fixes to the manager and chooser modals.

* If there is a `minSize` setting in play, that information is displayed to the user when choosing images.

* The `checkboxes` schema field type now supports the `browseFilters` feature.

* When batch file uploads fail, a more useful set of error messages are displayed.

## 2.19.1 (2017-03-15)

All tests passing.

* When saving any doc with a schema, if an attachment field does not match a valid attachment that has actually been uploaded, that field is correctly nulled out. In addition, if the attachment's file extension is not in a valid fileGroup as configured via the attachments module, the field is nulled out. Finally, the `crop: true` option for attachments is saved successfully. This option allows for attachments to have a crop that is inherent to them, useful when there is no widget standing between the doc and the attachment.

All of these changes correct bugs in intended behavior. Certain checks were present in the code but not completely functional. If you need to update your configuration to add file extensions, [apostrophe-attachments](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/modules/apostrophe-attachments/).

## 2.19.0 (2017-03-15)

All tests passing.

* As always, Apostrophe always populates `req.data.home`; when `req.data.page._ancestors[0]` exists that is used, otherwise Apostrophe carries out a separate query. However as a performance enhancement, you may now disable this additional query by passing the `home: false` option to the `apostrophe-pages` module. Note that `req.data.home` is not guaranteed to exist if you do this.

As for children of the home page, for performance you may now pass `home: { children: false }` option to the `apostrophe-pages` module. This option only comes into play when using `filters: { ancestors: false }`.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

## 2.18.2 (2017-03-10)

All tests passing.

* Performance enhancement: when fetching `req.data.home` directly in the absence of `req.data.page._ancestors[0]`, such as on the home page itself or a non-page route like `/login`, we must apply the same default filters before applying the filter options, namely `.areas(false).joins(false)`, otherwise duplicate queries are made.

* Fixed bug in as-yet-unused `schemas.export` method caught by babel's linter.

Thanks to Michelin for their support of this work.

## 2.18.0 (2017-03-04)

All tests passing.

* New batch editing features for pieces! You can now use the checkboxes to select many items and then carry out the following operations in one step: trash, rescue from trash, publish, unpublish, tag and untag.

In addition there is a clearly documented procedure for creating new batch editing features with a minimum of new code.

* Several bugs in the array editor were fixed. Up, down and remove buttons work properly again, an aesthetic glitch was resolved and redundant ordinal numbers do not creep in when managing the order of an array without the `titleField` option.

* Logging out completely destroys the session. While the standard behavior of `req.logout` in the Passport module is only to break the relationship between the `user` object and the session, users expect a clean break.

## 2.17.2 (2017-02-28)

All tests passing.

* Members of a group that has the admin permission for a specific piece type can now move pieces of that type to and from the trash. (This was always intended, so this is a bug fix.)
* For better out-of-the-box SEO, an `alt` attribute with the title of the image is now part of the `img` markup of `apostrophe-images` widgets.

## 2.17.1 (2017-02-21)

All tests passing.

* Fixed XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerability in `req.browserCall` and `apos.push.browserCall`.

* Removed confusing strikethrough of "Apply to Subpages" subform when the permission is being removed rather than added.

* Improved UX of area widget controls.

* Improved modal array tab UI and CSS.

* The `oembedReady` Apostrophe event is now emitted correctly after `apostrophe-oembed` renders an oembed-based player, such as a YouTube video player for the `apostrophe-video` widget. This event can be listened for via `apos.on('apostrophe-oembed', fn)` and receives a jQuery object referring to the relevant element.

## 2.17.0 (2017-02-14)

All tests passing.

* `array` schema fields now accept a `limit` option. They also support the `def` property to set defaults for individual fields. The array editor code has been refactored for better reliability and performance and documentation for the methods has been written.

* Relative `@import` statements now work when you push plain `.css` files as Apostrophe assets. There is no change in behavior for LESS files. Thanks to Fredrik Ekelund.

* Controls such as the "Finished" button of the reorganize modal were floating off the screen. This has been fixed.

## 2.16.1 (2017-02-07)

All tests passing.

* If you have tried using `piecesFilters` with a `tags` field type, you may have noticed that when the query string parameter is present but empty, you get no results. This is suboptimal because that's a common result if you use an HTML form to drive the query. An empty string for a `tags` filter now correctly does nothing.

* In `apostrophe-rich-text-widgets`, initialize CKEditor on `instanceReady`, rather than via a dodgy timeout. Thanks to Frederik Ekelund for finding a better way!

## 2.16.0 (2017-02-03)

All tests passing.

* Reintroduced the reorganize feature for editors who have permissions for some pages but not others. You are able to see the pages you can edit and also their ancestors, in order to navigate the tree. However you are able to drag pages only to parents you can edit.

* Introduced the new `deleteFromTrash` option to the `apostrophe-pages` module. If this option is enabled, a new icon appears in "reorganize" when looking at pages in the trash. This icon allows you to permanently delete a page and its descendants from the site.

The use of this option can lead to unhappy customers if they do not clearly understand it is a permanent action. For that reason, it is disabled by default. However it can be quite useful when transitioning from the initial site build to long-term support. We recommend enabling it during that period and disabling it again after cleanup.

* "Reorganize" no longer displays nonfunctional "view" and "trash" icons for the trash and pages inside it.

* The tests for the `apostrophe-locks` module are now deterministic and should always pass.

## 2.15.2 (2017-01-30)

All tests passing.

Fixed a bug which could cause a crash if the `sort` filter was explicitly set to `search` and no search was actually present. Conditions existed in which this could happen with the autocomplete route.

## 2.15.1 (2017-01-23)

Due to a miscommunication the version number 2.15.0 had been previously used. The description below was originally intended for 2.15.0 and has been published as 2.15.1 purely to address the version numbering conflict.

All tests passing.

* `apos.permissions.addPublic` accepts multiple arguments and array arguments,
adding all of the permission names given including any listed in the arrays.
* Permissions checks for pieces admin routes longer check for req.user, checking for the appropriate `edit-` permission is sufficient and makes addPublic more useful.
* Updated the `i18n` module to address a problem where labels that happened to be numbers rather than strings would crash the template if passed to `__()`.
* Documentation improvements.

## 2.14.3

All tests passing.

The mechanism that preserves text fields when performing AJAX refreshes was preserving
other types of `input` elements. Checkboxes, radio buttons and `type="submit"` are now
properly excluded from this mechanism.

## 2.14.2 (2017-01-18)

Fixed [#385](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/issues/385): if a page is moved to the trash, its slug must always change, even if it has been edited so that it no longer has its parent's slug as a prefix. In addition, if the resulting slug of a descendant of the page moving to the trash conflicts with an existing page in the trash, steps are taken to ensure uniqueness.

## 2.14.1 (2017-01-11)

All tests passing.

* The `apos.utils.clonePermanent` method no longer turns objects into long arrays of nulls if they happen to have a `length` property. `lodash` uses the `length` property as an indicator that the object should be treated as an array, but this would be an unrealistic restriction on Apostrophe schema field names. Instead, `clonePermanent` now uses `Array.isArray` to distinguish true arrays. This fixes a nasty bug when importing content from A1.5 and subsequently editing it.

* When a user is logged in there is an `apos.user` object on the browser side. Due to a bug this was an empty object. It now contains `title`, `_id` and `username` properties as intended.

## 2.14.0 (2017-01-06)

All tests passing.

* A version rollback dialog box for the `global` doc is now opened if an element with the `data-apos-versions-global` attribute is clicked. There is currently no such element in the standard UI but you may introduce one in your own layout if you have mission-critical content in the `global` doc that is awkward to recreate after an accidental deletion, such as a custom sitewide nav.
* An error message is correctly displayed when login fails.
* Many UI messages are now passed through the `__()` internationalization helper correctly. Thanks to `timaebi`.

## 2.13.2 (2016-12-22)

All tests passing.

The `data-apos-ajax-context` feature had a bug which prevented ordinary anchor links from performing AJAX refreshes correctly.

## 2.13.1 (2016-12-22)

All tests passing.

The `apostrophe-attachments` module now calls `apos.ui.busy` correctly on the fieldset so that the busy and completed indicators are correctly shown and hidden. Previously the string `0` was passed, which is not falsy.

## 2.12.0 (2016-12-15)

All tests passing.

* Developers are no longer required to set `instantiate: false` in `app.js` when configuring an npm module that uses the `improve` property to implicitly subclass and enhance a different module. In addition, bugs were fixed in the underlying `moog-require` module to ensure that assets can be loaded from the `public` and `views` folders of modules that use `improve`.
* `string` has replaced `csv` as the property name of the schema field converters that handle plaintext. Backwards compatibility has been implemented so that existing `csv` converters will work transparently and calls to `convert` with `csv` as the `from` argument still work as well. In all new custom field types you should say `string` rather than `csv`. There is no change in the functionality or implementation other than the name.

## 2.11.0 (2016-12-09)

All tests passing.

You can now add middleware to your Apostrophe site via any module in your project. Just add an `self.expressMiddleware` method to your module, which takes the usual `req, res, next` arguments. Or, if it's more convenient, set `self.expressMiddleware` to an array of such functions. "Module middleware" is added immediately after the minimum required Apostrophe middleware (bodyParser, `req.data`, etc), and before any routes.

## 2.10.3 (2016-12-08)

All tests passing.

Fixed bug in `autoPreserveText` feature of our `data-apos-ajax-context` mechanism; also, restricted it to text inputs and textareas that actually have the focus so that you can replace their values normally at other times

## 2.10.2 (2016-12-06)

All tests passing.

A very minor fix, but 2.10.1 had a very noisy console.log statement left in.

## 2.10.1 (2016-12-06)

All tests passing.

* The built-in cursor filters for `float` and `integer` no longer incorrectly default to filtering for docs with the value `0` if the value being filtered for is undefined or null. They default to not filtering at all, which is correct.

## 2.10.0 (2016-12-06)

All tests passing.

* Apostrophe now automatically recompiles modified Nunjucks templates. This means you can hit refresh in your browser after hitting save in your editor when working on `.html` files. Also note that this has always worked for `.less` files.
* Fixed a longstanding bug in `joinByArrayReverse`, which now works properly.

## 2.9.2 (2016-12-02)

All tests passing.

* Starting with MongoDB 3.3.x (?), it is an error to pass `safe: true` when calling `ensureIndex`, and it has never done anything in any version. In our defense, cargo-cult practice was probably adopted back in the days when MongoDB would invoke your write callback without actually confirming anything unless you passed `safe: true`, but apparently this was never a thing for indexes. Removed all the `safe: true` arguments from `ensureIndex` calls.
* Added a `beforeAjax` Apostrophe event to facilitate progress display and animations when using the new `data-apos-ajax-content` feature.

## 2.9.1 (2016-12-02)

All tests passing.

* Fixed an omission that prevented the use of the back button to undo the very first click when using the new `data-apos-ajax-context`. Later clicks worked just fine, but for the first one to work we need a call to `replaceState` to make it possible to restore the original query.

## 2.9.0 (2016-12-01)

All tests passing.

* Two major new features in this release: built-in filters for most schema fields, and built-in AJAX support for `apostrophe-pieces-pages`. These combine to eliminate the need for custom code in a wide array of situations where you wish to allow users to browse and filter blog posts, events, etc. In most cases there is no longer any need to write your own `cursor.js` or your own AJAX implementation. The provided AJAX implementation handles browser history operations, bookmarking and sharing properly and is SEO-friendly.

[See the official summary of the pull request for details and examples of usage.](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/pull/766)

* We also fixed a bug in the `refinalize` feature of cursors. state.criteria is now cloned before finalize and restored after it. Otherwise many criteria are added twice after refinalize which causes a fatal error with a few, like text search in mongodb.

In addition, we merged a contribution from Fotis Paraskevopoulos that allows a `bodyParser` option with `json` and `urlencoded` properties to be passed to the `apostrophe-express` module. Those properties are passed on to configure those two body parser middleware functions.

## 2.8.0 (2016-11-28)

All tests passing.

* `APOS_MONGODB_URI` environment variable is used to connect to MongoDB if present. Helpful for cloud hosting. See the new [deploying Apostrophe in the cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html).
* `APOS_S3_BUCKET`, `APOS_S3_ENDPOINT` (optional), `APOS_S3_SECRET`, `APOS_S3_KEY`, and `APOS_S3_REGION` environment variables can be used to configure Apostrophe to use S3 for uploaded media storage. This behavior kicks in if `APOS_S3_BUCKET` is set. See the new [deploying Apostrophe in the cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html).
* New advisory locking API accessible via `apos.locks.lock` and `apos.locks.unlock`. `apostrophe-migrations:migrate` is now wrapped in a lock. More locks are coming, although Apostrophe was carefully designed for benign worst case outcomes during race conditions.
* Better asset deployment for Heroku and other cloud services. `node app apostrophe:generation --create-bundle=NAME` now creates a new folder, `NAME`, containing assets that would otherwise have been written to `public`. Launching a server with the `APOS_BUNDLE` environment variable set to `NAME` will then copy that bundle's contents into `public` before listening for connections. See the new [deploying Apostrophe in the cloud HOWTO](http://apostrophecms.org/docs/tutorials/howtos/deploying-apostrophe-in-the-cloud.html).
* `apostrophe-pieces-pages` index pages are about 2x faster; discovered we were inefficiently deep-cloning `req` when cloning a cursor.
* Helpful error message if you forget to set the `name` property of one of your `types` when configuring `apostrophe-pages`.

## 2.7.0 (2016-11-16)

* We do a better job of defaulting to a sort by search match quality if full-text search is present in a query. Under the hood this is powered by the new `defaultSort` filter, which just stores a default value for the `sort` filter to be used only if `search` (and anything else with an implicit preferred sort order) is not present. No more lame search results for blog posts. You can explicitly set the `sort()` filter in a cursor override if you really want to, but trust us, when `search` is present sorting by anything but search quality produces poor results.
* Fixed bugs in the sanitizer for page slugs. It is now impossible to save a slug with trailing or consecutive slashes (except the home page slug which is allowed to consist of a single "trailing" slash). Added unit tests.
* Apostrophe's dropdown menus, etc. will more robustly maintain their font size in the presence of project-level CSS. There is an explicit default font size for `.apos-ui`.

## 2.6.2 (2016-11-12)

All tests passing.

* The auto-suggestion of titles upon uploading files also suggests slugs.
* The auto-suggestion of titles and slugs applies to both "files" and "images."
* Reduce the clutter in the versions collection by checking for meaningful change on the server side, where final sanitization of HTML, etc. has taken place to iron out distinctions without a difference.
* Use the permission name `edit-attachment` consistently, so that calling `addPublic('edit-attachment')` has the intended effect.
* Manage view of pieces does not crash if `updatedAt` is missing from a piece.

## 2.6.1 (2016-11-08)

All tests passing.

* Choosers and schema arrays play nicely with the new fixed-position tabs.
* Better CSS solution to positioning the attachment upload buttons which doesn't interfere with other styles.
* Images in the chooser choices column "stay in their lane."
* Better error message when an attempt to edit an area with a hyphenated name is used.
* Array edit button fixed.
* The `type()` cursor filter now has a finalizer and merges its criteria there at the very end, so that you can override a previous call to it at any time prior to invoking `toArray` or similar.
* Area controls no longer interfere with visibility of widget type selection menu.

## 2.6.0 (2016-11-04)

All tests passing.

* `relationship` fields defined for `joinByArray` can now have an `inline: true` flag. If they are inline, they are presented right in the chooser, rather than appearing in a separate modal dialog reachable by clicking an icon. This feature should be used sparingly, but that's true of relationship fields in general.
* Permissions editing for pages now takes advantage of the new inline relationship fields to make the "apply to subpages" functionality easier to discover.
* When uploading files or images, the title field is automatically suggested based on the filename.
* Improvements in form field UX and design.
* When choosing pieces (including images), if you elect to create a new piece it is automatically added to the selection.
* When choosing pieces, if the `limit` is reached and it is greater than 1, a helpful message appears, and the UI changes to make clear that you cannot add items until you remove one. If the limit is exactly 1, a new selection automatically replaces the current selection, and singular language is used to clarify what is happening.
* Syntax errors in "related types" such as cursors now produce an improved error message with filename and line number.
* Showstopper errors during startup are reported in a less redundant way.

## 2.5.2 (2016-11-01)

All tests passing.

* New `blockLevelControls: true` option to areas ensures controls for "blocks," i.e. "layout" widgets whose primary purpose is to contain other widgets, can be easily distinguished from controls for "regular" areas nested inside them. Think of a "two-column" or "three-column" widget with three areas in its template. The controls for these areas are displayed in a distinct color and various visual affordances are made to ensure they are accessible when things would otherwise be tightly spaces.
* General improvements to the usability of area-related controls.
* The search index now correctly includes the text of string and select schema fields found in widgets, pieces, pages, etc., as it always did before in 0.5. You may use `searchable: false` to disable this on a per-field basis.
* Search indexing has been refactored for clarity (no changes to working APIs).
* Checkboxes for the `checkboxes` schema field type are now styled.
* "View file" links in the file library are now styled as buttons.

## 2.5.1 (2016-10-28)

All tests passing.

* The `minSize` option to `apostrophe-images` widgets now works properly when cropping.
* The cropper no longer starts out cropping to the entire image, as this made it unclear what was happening. However if you click the crop button and then just save you still get reasonable behavior.
* Bigger crop handles.
* Textarea focus state receives the same "glow" as a regular text input field.
* Small documentation updates.

## 2.5.0 (2016-10-21)

All tests passing.

* Implemented `apos.areas.fromPlaintext`, which accepts a string of plaintext (not markup) and returns an area with a single `apostrophe-rich-text` widget in it, containing that text. Useful in implementing importers.
* The so-called `csv` import mode of `apos.schemas.convert` works properly for areas, using the above. Although it is called csv this mode is really suitable for any situation in which you have plaintext representations of each property in an object and would like those sanitized and converted to populate a doc.
* Bug fix: emit the `enhance` Apostrophe event only once on page load. This event is emitted only when there is new content that has been added to the page, e.g. once at page load, and also when a new widget is added or updated, etc. The first argument to your event handler will be a jQuery element which will contain only new elements.
* Legacy support for `data/port` and `data/address` files has been restored. (Note that `PORT` and `ADDRESS` environment variables supersede these. In modern Stagecoach deployments `data/port` is often a space-separated list of ports, and the `deployment/start` script parses these out and launches multiple processes with different PORT variables.)

## 2.4.0 (2016-10-19)

All tests passing.

Workarounds for two limitations in MongoDB that impact the use of Apostrophe cursors:

* The `addLateCriteria` cursor filter has been introduced. This filter should be used only when
you need to invoke `$near` or another MongoDB operator that cannot be used within `$and`. The object
you pass to `addLateCriteria` is merged with the criteria object that is built normally by the cursor.
**Use of this filter is strongly discouraged unless you must use operators that do
not support `$and`.**
* Custom filters that invoke `$near` or other MongoDB operators that are incompatible
with `$text` queries may call `self.set('regexSearch', true)` to force the cursor to use
a regular expression search rather than full MongoDB full-text search, if and when the
`search()` filter is called on the same cursor. This was implemented to allow combination
of full-text and geographical searches, subject of course to the limitation that regular expression
search is not indexed. It also doesn't sort by quality, but `$near` provides its own sort
by distance.

Since these are new features a minor version level bump is appropriate. However neither of these is a feature that a typical site developer will need to call directly.

## 2.3.2 (2016-10-17)

All tests passing.

* The quality of the autocomplete search results shown when selecting pages or pieces via a join was low. This has been corrected by calling the `.sort('search')` filter to sort by search result quality rather than the default sort order for the doc type manager in question.
* All of the autocomplete suggestions fit on the screen on reasonably sized displays. With the recent addition of the "flip" feature to push the suggestions up rather than down if the bottom of the screen would otherwise be reached, this is critical to show the first and best suggestion. Further discussion for future UX improvement in [issue 704](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/issues/704).

## 2.3.1 (2016-10-13)

All tests passing.

* Fixed a bug in the new "copy page" feature that affects pages that have `null` properties.
* Improved the experience of using the widget controls to manage the widgets in an area.
* The `login` module now has an alias, `apos.login`, like other core modules.
* Updated the jquery projector plugin to the latest version.

## 2.3.0 (2016-10-06)

All tests passing.

* Fixed a bug affecting the use of `arrangeFields` in modules that extend another module's use of `arrangeFields`. Added unit test based directly on a real-world project.
* `baseUrl` project-wide option added, yielding the same benefit as in 0.5: you get absolute URLs for all pages everywhere. (If you don't want absolute URLs, just don't set it.) This is very beneficial when generating `og:meta` tags for Facebook, or generating emails.
* A direct link to the original file has been added to the file manager's editor modal.

## 2.2.2 (2016-10-05)

All tests passing.

* Addition of slugs to projection for autocomplete is now done in a way that still allows overrides at the doc level to add other properties.
* Addition of slugs to projection for autocomplete works for joins with a specific page type, too.
* Fixed a chicken-and-egg problem in the global module that kicked in if the "global" doc contains widgets powered by modules not yet initialized at the time the global module checks for the existence of the doc.

## 2.2.1 (2016-10-04)

All tests passing.

Fixed an oversight: the new `pageBeforeCopy` global method now takes `req` as its first parameter. Since `2.2.0` was first published 5 minutes ago and this method has not yet been documented this is not regarded as a bc break.

## 2.2.0 (2016-10-04)

All tests passing.

* Fixed bug that broke removal of permissions for pages.
* "Copy Page" feature added to the page menu.
* Automatically reposition the autocomplete dropdown for joins if it would collide with the bottom of the window.
* Include page slugs in the autocomplete dropdown for joins with pages.
* `chooserChoiceBase.html` restored; some projects were depending on extending it, which is a useful technique.

## 2.1.5 (2016-10-01)

All tests passing.

* Admin bar: previously grouped fields can be re-grouped successfully, so concatenating admin bar configuration works just as well as concatenating `addFields` arrays
* Files widget displays upload button in the same user-friendly position as the images widget
* Font size for tabs and help labels is explicit to avoid side effects from project-level CSS

## 2.1.4 (2016-09-23)

All tests passing.

* Previously chosen items that now reside in the trash no longer break the chooser for editing joins
* All joins editable; certain edge cases weren't getting blessed
* A field appears properly when two diferent choices list it for `showFields`
* As in 0.5, a required field hidden by `showFields` is not required (but will be if you elect the choice that shows it)

## 2.1.3 (2016-09-20)

All tests passing.

* A typo in the unit tests caused unit tests to fail. This has been fixed.
* The recent addition of the HTML5 doctype caused the login page to be invisible in the sandbox project (not the boilerplate project). This has been fixed.
* The recent addition of the HTML5 doctype caused the admin bar to appear with a slight visual defect. This has been fixed.

## 2.1.2 (2016-09-19)

Fix for [#668](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe/issues/668), crash occurring when admin bar group leader starts out too close to the end of the admin bar items array.

## 2.1.1 (2016-09-18)

Full Windows compatibility restored. The "recursively copy asset folders if on Windows" behavior from 0.5 was reimplemented. This is necessary to allow Apostrophe to run as a non-administrator on Windows. Running as administrator is the moral equivalent of running as root on Linux, which we would never recommend.

Since Apostrophe did not function previously on Windows and there is no behavior change on Mac/Linux this is effectively a bug fix rather than a new feature, thus 2.1.1.

## 2.1.0 (2016-09-16)

* Introduced the new `apos.areas.richText` and `apos.areas.plaintext` methods, which are also available in templates by the same names.

* Added and documented the `addImageSizes` option of the `apostrophe-attachments` module.

## 2.0.4 (2016-09-14)

* The `apostrophe-login` module now invokes `loginAfterLogin(req, callback)` on all modules that have such a method, via `apos.callAll`. Modules that do not need a callback can supply this method with only one argument. Afterwards, `apostrophe-login` redirects to `req.redirect`, as is supported elsewhere in Apostrophe. So you can assign to `req.redirect` in your callback to change the user's destination after a successful login. If `req.redirect` is not set, the user is redirected to the home page.

## 2.0.3 (2016-09-13)

The `ancestors` and `children` filters defaulted to `areas(false)`, but `joins(false)` was omitted, contrary to documentation which has always indicated the information returned is limited for performance. This was fixed. You can still override freely with the `filters` option to `apostrophe-pages`.

The HTML5 doctype was added to `outerLayoutBase`. HTML5 was always assumed, and the absence of the doctype broke jQuery's support for distinguishing `$(window).height()` from `$(document).height()`, causing runaway infinite scroll loading.

Warning message instructions for configuring the session secret were fixed (the actual location has not changed).

## 2.0.2 (2016-09-08)

Previously the `contextual` flag of a pieces module was not considered before deciding to redirect to the "show page" for the piece, which might not exist. This has been fixed. It should only happen when the module has `contextual: true`, creating a reasonable expectation that such a page must exist.

## 2.0.1 (2016-09-05)

Packaging and documentation issues only.

## 2.0.0 (2016-09-03)

Inaugural npm release of Apostrophe 2.x, which was used prior to that in many projects via git dependencies.
